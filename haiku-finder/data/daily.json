For the past seven years, he has been collecting municipal records of murders, and he now has the largest catalogue of killings in the country—751,785 murders carried out since 1976, which is roughly twenty-seven thousand more than appear in F.B.I. files. States are supposed to report murders to the Department of Justice, but some report inaccurately, or fail to report altogether, and Hargrove has sued some of these states to obtain their records. Using computer code he wrote, he searches his archive for statistical anomalies among the more ordinary murders resulting from lovers’ triangles, gang fights, robberies, or brawls. Each year, about five thousand people kill someone and don’t get caught, and a percentage of these men and women have undoubtedly killed more than once. Hargrove intends to find them with his code, which he sometimes calls a serial-killer detector.</p>\n<p>Hargrove created the code, which operates as a simple algorithm, in 2010, when he was a reporter for the now defunct Scripps Howard news service. The algorithm forms the basis of the Murder Accountability Project (<em class=\"small\">MAP</em>), a nonprofit that consists of Hargrove—who is retired—a database, a <a href=\"http://www.murderdata.org/\">Web site</a>, and a board of nine members, who include former detectives, homicide scholars, and a forensic psychiatrist. By a process of data aggregating, the algorithm gathers killings that are related by method, place, and time, and by the victim’s sex. It also considers whether the rate of unsolved murders in a city is notable, since an uncaught serial killer upends a police department’s percentages. Statistically, a town with a serial killer in its midst looks lawless.</p>\n<p>In August of 2010, Hargrove noticed a pattern of murders in Lake County, Indiana, which includes the city of Gary. Between 1980 and 2008, fifteen women had been strangled. Many of the bodies had been found in vacant houses. Hargrove wrote to the Gary police, describing the murders and including a spreadsheet of their circumstances. “Could these cases reflect the activity of one or more serial killers in your area?” he asked.</p>\n<p>The police department rebuffed him; a lieutenant replied that there were no unsolved serial killings in Gary. (The Department of Justice advises police departments to tell citizens when a serial killer is at large, but some places keep the information secret.) Hargrove was indignant. “I left messages for months,” he said. “I sent registered letters to the chief of police and the mayor.” Eventually, he heard from a deputy coroner, who had also started to suspect that there was a serial killer in Gary. She had tried to speak with the police, but they had refused her. After reviewing Hargrove’s cases, she added three more victims to his list.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Four years later, the police in Hammond, a town next to Gary, got a call about a disturbance at a Motel 6, where they found a dead woman in a bathtub. Her name was Afrikka Hardy, and she was nineteen years old. “They make an arrest of a guy named Darren Vann, and, as so often happens in these cases, he says, ‘You got me,’ ” Hargrove said. “Over several days, he takes police to abandoned buildings where they recover the bodies of six women, all of them strangled, just like the pattern we were seeing in the algorithm.” Vann had killed his first woman in the early nineties. In 2009, he went to jail for rape, and the killings stopped. When he got out, in 2013, Hargrove said, “he picked up where he’d left off.”</p>\n</section><section><p>Researchers study serial killers as if they were specimens of natural history. One of the most comprehensive catalogues is the Radford Serial Killer Data Base, which has nearly five thousand entries from around the world—the bulk of them from the United States—and was started twenty-five years ago by Michael Aamodt, a professor emeritus at Radford University, in Virginia. According to the database, American serial killers are ten times more likely to be male than female. Ray Copeland, who was seventy-five when he was arrested, killed at least five drifters on his farm in Missouri late in the last century, and is the oldest serial killer in the database. The youngest is Robert Dale Segee, who grew up in Portland, Maine, and, in 1938, at the age of eight, is thought to have killed a girl with a rock. Segee’s father often punished him by holding his fingers over a candle flame, and Segee became an arsonist. After starting a fire, he sometimes saw visions of a crimson man with fangs and claws, and flames coming out of his head. In June of 1944, when Segee was fourteen, he got a job with the Ringling Brothers circus. The next month, the circus tent caught fire, and a hundred and sixty-eight people were killed. In 1950, after being arrested for a different fire, Segee confessed to setting the tent ablaze, but years later he withdrew his confession, saying that he had been mad when he made it.</p>\n<p>Serial killers are not usually particularly bright, having an average I.Q. of 94.5, according to the database. They divide into types. Those who feel bound to rid the world of people they regard as immoral or undesirable—such as drug addicts, immigrants, or promiscuous women—are called missionaries. Black widows kill men, usually to inherit money or to claim insurance; bluebeards kill women, either for money or as an assertion of power. A nurse who kills patients is called an angel of death. A troller meets a victim by chance, and a trapper either observes his victims or works at a place, such as a hospital, where his victims come to him.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The F.B.I. believes that less than one per cent of the killings each year are carried out by serial killers, but Hargrove thinks that the percentage is higher, and that there are probably around two thousand serial killers at large in the U.S. “How do I know?” he said. “A few years ago, I got some people at the F.B.I. to run the question of how many murders in their records are unsolved but have been linked through DNA.” The answer was about fourteen hundred, slightly more than two per cent of the murders in the files they consulted. “Those are just the cases they were able to lock down with DNA,” Hargrove said. “And killers don’t always leave DNA—it’s a gift when you get it. So two per cent is a floor, not a ceiling.”</p>\n</section><section><p>Hargrove is sixty-one. He is tall and slender, with a white beard and a skeptical regard. He lives with his wife and son in Alexandria, Virginia, and walks eight miles a day, to Mount Vernon or along the Potomac, while listening to recordings of books—usually mystery novels. He was born in Manhattan, but his parents moved to Yorktown, in Westchester County, when he was a boy. “I lived near Riverside Drive until I was four,” he said. “Then one day I showed my mom what I learned on the playground, which is that you can make a switchblade out of Popsicle sticks, and next thing I knew I was living in Yorktown.”</p>\n<p>Hargrove’s father wrote technical manuals on how to use mechanical calculators, and when Hargrove went to college, at the University of Missouri, he studied computational journalism and public opinion. He learned practices such as random-digit-dialling theory, which is used to conduct polls, and he was influenced by “Precision Journalism,” a book by Philip Meyer that encourages journalists to learn survey methods from social science. After graduating, in 1977, he was hired by the Birmingham <em>Post-Herald</em>, in Alabama, with the understanding that he would conduct polls and do whatever else the paper needed. As it turned out, the paper needed a crime reporter. In 1978, Hargrove saw his first man die, the owner of a convenience store who had been shot during a robbery. He reported on a riot that began after police officers shot a sixteen-year-old African-American girl. Once, arriving at a standoff, he was shot at with a rifle by a drunk on a water tower. The bullet hit the gravel near his feet and made a sound that “was not quite a plink.” He also covered the execution of a man named John Lewis Evans, the first inmate put to death in Alabama after a Supreme Court abrogation of capital punishment in the nineteen-sixties and seventies. “They electrocuted people in Alabama in an electric chair called the Yellow Mama, because it was painted bright yellow,” Hargrove said. “Enough time had passed since the last execution that no one remembered how to do it. The first time, too much current went through too small a conduit, so everything caught fire. Everyone was crying, and I had trouble sleeping for days after.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>In 1990, Hargrove moved to Washington, D.C., to work for Scripps Howard, where, he said, “my primary purpose was to use numbers to shock people.” Studying the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File—“where we will all end up one day,” Hargrove said—he noticed that some people were included for a given year and dropped a few years later: people who had mistakenly been declared dead. From interviews, he learned that these people often have their bank accounts suddenly frozen, can’t get credit cards or mortgages, and are refused jobs because they fail background checks. Comparing a list of federal grants for at-risk kids in inner-city schools against Census Bureau Zip Codes, he found that two-thirds of the grants were actually going to schools in the suburbs. “He did all this through really clever logic and programming,” Isaac Wolf, a former journalist who had a desk near Hargrove’s, told me. “A combination of resourceful thinking and an innovative approach to collecting and analyzing data through shoe-leather work.”</p>\n<p>In 2004, Hargrove was assigned a story about prostitution. To learn which cities enforced laws against the practice and which didn’t, he requested a copy of the Uniform Crime Report, an annual compilation published by the F.B.I., and received a CD containing the most recent report, from 2002. “Along with it, at no extra cost, was something that said ‘S.H.R. 2002,’ ” he said. It was the F.B.I.’s Supplementary Homicide Report, which includes all the murders reported to the Bureau, listing the age, race, sex, and ethnicity of the victim, along with the method and circumstances of the killing. As Hargrove looked through it, “the first thing I thought was, I wonder if it’s possible to teach a computer to spot serial victims.” Hargrove said that for six years he told each of his editors at Scripps Howard that he wanted to find serial killers using a computer, and the response was always, “You’re kidding, right?”</p>\n<p>In 2007, Hargrove did an investigation into <em class=\"small\">SIDS</em>, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, after wondering why, according to the Centers for Disease Control’s infant-mortality records, so many more babies in Florida died from accidental suffocation than did babies in California, even though California had many more babies. During the following year, Hargrove interviewed coroners and pathologists around the country. “A growing number of them began saying, ‘To be honest, I might get in trouble for saying this, but <em class=\"small\">SIDS</em> doesn’t exist as such,’ ” he said. Hargrove concluded that <em class=\"small\">SIDS</em> wasn’t a diagnosis or a mysterious disease but the result of people putting babies in their cribs in such a way that they suffocated during sleep. Florida tended to attribute these deaths to accidental suffocation, California to <em class=\"small\">SIDS</em>. In the aftermath of his story, the C.D.C. created the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Registry to evaluate each death. Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey senator, met with Hargrove and then introduced the Sudden Death Data Enhancement and Awareness Act, which President Obama signed in 2014. After the <em class=\"small\">SIDS</em> story, Hargrove’s stock rose “insanely high in the newsroom,” he said. He told his boss that he still wanted to try to teach a computer to detect serial killers, and this time his boss said, “You’ve got a year.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>Hargrove began by requesting homicide reports from 1980 to 2008; they included more than five hundred thousand murders. At the start, he knew “what the computer didn’t know,” he said. “I could see the victims in the data.” He began trying to write an algorithm that could return the victims of a convicted killer. As a test case, he chose Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer, who, starting in the early eighties, murdered at least forty-eight women in Seattle, and left them beside the Green River. Above his desk, Hargrove taped a mugshot of Ridgway in which he looks tired and sullen. Underneath it, he wrote, “What do serial victims look like statistically?”</p>\n<p>Creating the algorithm was laborious work. “He would write some code, and it would run through what seemed like an endless collection of records,” Isaac Wolf told me. “And we did not have expensive computer equipment, so it would run for days. It was sort of jerry-rigged, Scotch-Taped. He was always tinkering.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0f5b02c536117403370de5}}--></div><p>Ridgway was eventually identified by DNA and was arrested in 2001, as he was leaving his job at a Kenworth truck plant, where he had worked as a painter for thirty-two years. He told the police that strangling women was his actual career. “Choking is what I did, and I was pretty good at it,” he said. Ridgway’s wife—his third—was astonished to find out what he had done. They had met at a Parents Without Partners gathering and had been married for seventeen years. She said that he had always treated her like a newlywed. Ridgway had considered killing his first two wives but decided that he was too likely to get caught. Mostly, he killed prostitutes, and, if he killed one who had money on her, he regarded it as his payment for killing her.</p>\n<p>Hargrove began each day with a review of what had failed the day before. He sorted the homicides by type, since he had been told that serial killers often strangle or bludgeon their victims, apparently because they prefer to prolong the encounter. He selected for women, because the F.B.I. said that seventy per cent of serial-killer victims are female. Each test took a day. He had no idea if anything would work. For a while, the only promising variable seemed to be “failure to solve.” “After a hundred things that didn’t work, that worked a <em>little</em> bit,” Hargrove said, holding his right thumb and forefinger close together. “I started making the terms more specific, looking at a group of factors—women, weapon, age, and location.”</p>\n<p>With those terms, the algorithm organized the killings into approximately ten thousand groups. One might be: Boston, women, fifteen to nineteen years old, and handguns. Another might be: New Orleans, women, twenty to fifty, and strangulation. Since “failure to solve” had produced results, even if feeble, Hargrove told the computer to notify him of places where solution rates were unusually low. Seattle came in third, with most of the victims women whose cause of death was unknown—unknown because the bodies had been left outside and sufficient time had passed that the coroners could no longer determine how they had died. The computer, Hargrove knew, had finally seen Ridgway’s victims.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>By reading meaning into the geography of victims and their killers, Hargrove is unwittingly invoking a discipline called geographic profiling, which is exemplified in the work of Kim Rossmo, a former policeman who is now a professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Texas State University. In 1991, Rossmo was on a train in Japan when he came up with an equation that can be used to predict where a serial killer lives, based on factors such as where the crimes were committed and where the bodies were found. As a New York City homicide detective told me, “Serial killers tend to stick to a killing field. They’re hunting for prey in a concentrated area, which can be defined and examined.” Usually, the hunting ground will be far enough from their homes to conceal where they live, but not so far that the landscape is unfamiliar. The farther criminals travel, the less likely they are to act, a phenomenon that criminologists call distance decay.</p>\n<p>Rossmo has used geographic profiling to track terrorists—he studied where they lived, where they stored weapons, and the locations of the phone booths they used to make calls—and to identify places where epidemics began. He also worked with zoologists, to examine the hunting patterns of white sharks. Recently, Rossmo studied where the street artist Banksy left his early work, and found evidence to support the British <em>Daily Mail’s</em> assertion, made in 2008 but never corroborated, that Banksy is a middle-aged man from Bristol, England, named Robin Gunningham.</p>\n<p>“In a murder investigation, when you step away from the Hollywood mystique, it’s about information,” Rossmo told me. “In any serial-murder case, the police are going to have thousands and thousands, even tens of thousands, of suspects.” In the Green River case, the police had eighteen thousand names. “So where do you start? We know quite a lot about the journey to a crime. By noting where killings took place or the bodies were discovered, you can actually create probability distributions.” In his book “Geographic Profiling,” Rossmo notes research that found, among other things, that right-handed criminals tend to turn left when fleeing but throw away evidence to the right, and that most criminals, when hiding in buildings, stay near the outside walls.</p>\n<p>Using computers to find killers has historical precedent. Eric Witzig, a retired homicide detective and a former F.B.I. intelligence analyst who is on <em class=\"small\">MAP</em>’s board, worked on the F.B.I.’s Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, <em class=\"small\">V</em>i<em class=\"small\">CAP</em>, which was started by a Los Angeles homicide detective named Pierce Brooks. Witzig told me how, in the fifties, Brooks worked on the case of Harvey Glatman, who became known as the Lonely Hearts Killer. Glatman was a radio-and-TV repairman and an amateur photographer who would invite young women to model for him, saying that the photographs were for detective magazines. He would tie his victim up for the shoot, and then never remove the bonds. “The victim, a young woman, was not just tied up, but the turns of the bindings were sharp and precise, indicating that the offender took a lot of pleasure in it,” Witzig said.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Brooks started to research the way that some killers seemed to commit the same crime repeatedly. He began putting all his murder records onto three-by-five cards, and after becoming interested in computers in the late nineteen-fifties he asked the L.A. police department to buy him one. He was told that it was too expensive. In 1983, he presented the idea of a homicide-tracking computer database to Congress, after which the F.B.I. offered him a job at Quantico and bought him the equipment to start <em class=\"small\">V</em>i<em class=\"small\">CAP</em>. The program was meant to be an accessory to investigations, but detectives didn’t take to it. “The first and maybe main problem was the original <em class=\"small\">V</em>i<em class=\"small\">CAP</em> reporting form,” Witzig said. Brooks wanted to record every element of a homicide and, as a result, there were more than a hundred and fifty questions. “Of course, there was user resistance,” Witzig said. “No one wanted to do more paperwork.” He added that the program had “some of the brightest law-enforcement deep thinkers in the world involved, but we exist at <em class=\"small\">MAP</em> because they failed.”</p>\n</section><section><p>M<em class=\"small\">AP</em> has its own limitations. Since the algorithm relies on place as a search term, it is blind to killers who are nomadic over any range greater than adjacent counties. There is also a species of false positive that Hargrove calls the Flint effect: some cities, such as Flint, Michigan, are so delinquent in solving murders that they look as if they were beset by serial killers.</p>\n<p>Someone versed in statistics can run the algorithm, which appears on <em class=\"small\">MAP</em>’s Web site. The rest of us, who might, for example, wish to know how many killings are unsolved where we live, can use the site’s “search cases” function. Deborah Smith, who lives in New Orleans, is a hobby <em class=\"small\">MAP</em> searcher and a forum moderator on Websleuths, an online watering hole for amateur detectives. “I keep spreadsheets of murdered and missing women around the country, with statistics, and I highlight murders that I think might be related,” she told me. “I have them for nearly every state, and that comes from <em class=\"small\">MAP</em>. If I have a killer, like, say, Israel Keys, who was in Seattle about fifteen years ago, I’ll look up murders in Seattle and parts of Alaska, because he lived there, too, and see if there were any the police might have overlooked.” She added, “<em class=\"small\">MAP</em> is just extremely, extremely useful for that. There isn’t really anything else like it.”</p>\n<p><em class=\"small\">MAP</em>’s board hasn’t determined what to do with the algorithm’s findings, however, and the question presents moral and practical difficulties for Hargrove. “We have to figure out our rules of engagement,” he told me. “Under what scenario do we start calling police?” A few months ago, Hargrove informed the Cleveland police that there appeared to be about sixty murders, all of women, that might involve a serial killer, or, from the range of methods, perhaps even three serial killers. Twelve of the women had convictions for prostitution, and their bodies were found in two distinct geographic clusters. Hargrove can’t say anything about his exchange with the Cleveland police, because <em class=\"small\">MAP</em>’s rules dictate that such communications are privileged. The police wrote me that, as a result of Hargrove’s analysis, “a small taskforce is being considered to look at several unsolved homicides.” The head of the department’s special-investigations bureau, James McPike, <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/02/could_an_algorithm_help_detect.html\">told</a> the Cleveland <em>Plain-Dealer</em>, of <em class=\"small\">MAP</em>, “We’re going to be working with the group to help us identify what we might be able to do.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Hargrove is pleased about the investigation but he also worries that something may go awry. “What if they arrest the wrong guy, and he sues?” he asked. “I contacted a bunch of police departments in 2010, when I was a reporter, because I wanted to see if the algorithm worked. Now I know it works—there’s no question in my mind. In certain places, we can say, ‘These victims have an elevated probability of having a common killer.’ In 2010, though, I had a big media company behind me, with lawyers and media insurance. Now I’m a guy with a nonprofit that has fourteen hundred dollars in the bank and a board of nine directors and no insurance.”</p>\n<p>One of <em class=\"small\">MAP</em>’s most public benefits has been making people aware of how few murders in America are solved. In 1965, a killing led to an arrest more than ninety-two per cent of the time. In 2016, the number was slightly less than sixty per cent, which was the lowest rate since records started being kept. Los Angeles had the best rate of solution, seventy-three per cent, and Detroit the worst, fourteen per cent. As Enzo Yaksic, a <em class=\"small\">MAP</em> board member and the director of the Northeastern University Atypical Homicide Research Group, told me, the project “demonstrates that there’s a whole population of unapprehended killers that are clearly out there.”</p>\n<p>Another of <em class=\"small\">MAP</em>’s board members, Michael Arntfield, is a professor at the University of Western Ontario, where he runs a cold-case society. It is focussing on the largest finding of the algorithm, a collection of a hundred unsolved murders of women in the Atlanta area over forty years. Most of the victims were African-American, and all were strangled. From the Atlanta police, Arntfield got names for forty-four of the women, and has been learning more about them. (Studying the backgrounds of murder victims in the hope of discovering how they met their killers is a discipline called victimology.) Arntfield and his colleagues separated the victims into two groups: a small group of older women, who were killed in their homes, and a larger group of young women, many of whom may have been prostitutes. From newspaper accounts, Arntfield has found two men who have committed crimes with strikingly similar attributes, both of whom are already in prison. Adam Lee, the head of Atlanta’s Major Crime Section, which includes homicide, told me that the police haven’t yet linked these murders to a particular killer, but he said that he considers <em class=\"small\">MAP</em> a useful tool and is “very interested in sitting down with Arntfield.”</p>\n<p>Hargrove told me he hopes that eventually detectives will begin to use the algorithm to connect cases themselves, and that <em class=\"small\">MAP</em> will help solve a murder.

Michelle Goldberg, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/opinion/al-franken-sexual-harassment.html\">writing</a> in the <em>Times</em>, says yes, in order to preserve the momentum of “the\ncurrent movement toward unprecedented accountability for sexual\nharassers.” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/11/17/im-a-feminist-i-study-rape-culture-and-i-dont-want-al-franken-to-resign/?utm_term=.cee043fecbaa\">Writing</a> in the Washington <em>Post</em>, Kate Harding says no: as a legislator, Franken\nhas done good things for women, and, as a repentant sexual harasser in\npolitics, he could do even more. Both arguments clearly have merit, and\nboth of the writers acknowledge that the opposing view is compelling.\nBut maybe “Should Al Franken resign?” is the wrong question.</p>\n<p>The question frames the conversation in terms of retribution, but it is\nnot possible to hold to account every man who has ever behaved\ndisrespectfully and disgustingly toward a woman. Nor even every senator,\n<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/when-does-a-watershed-become-a-sex-panic\">or every\ncomedian</a>.\nAnd, even if it were possible to punish every single one of them, what\nwould be accomplished? Punishment, especially when it is delayed, is not\na very effective deterrent.</p>\n<p>The current wave of revelations began with the stories of women who said\nthat they had been abused by the Hollywood producer <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories\">Harvey Weinstein</a>. At\nthe heart of these allegations were not just the harrowing physical\nacts but also the act of what amounted to hostage-taking. Weinstein\nmade sexual contact a condition of actresses’ careers—their future.\nSilence was another condition. For Weinstein’s victims, every role and\nevery accolade came with the private shame of knowing the price they had\npaid. Even as young actresses grew into stars, Weinstein’s power over\nthem did not diminish. His power got him sex, and the sex gave him more\npower.</p>\n<p>Even the ways in which Weinstein faced pushback for his behavior were\nframed in terms of male power. The second <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">story</a> on Weinstein contained an account of the producer’s advances toward\nGwyneth Paltrow, who was twenty-two at the time. The actress told her\nthen boyfriend, Brad Pitt, who proceeded to confront Weinstein—and\nWeinstein, in turn, berated and threatened Paltrow for breaking the\nsilence. <em>People</em> magazine followed up with a fawning\n<a href=\"http://people.com/movies/inside-story-how-brad-pitt-threatened-harvey-weinstein-with-a-missouri-whooping-after-gwyneth-paltrow-incident/\">story</a> that emphasized the courage it must have taken for Pitt to poke\nWeinstein in the chest and say, “You will not ever do this to Gwyneth\never again”; otherwise, according to the article, Pitt threatened to\nbeat Weinstein up. What Pitt does not appear to have done is threaten to\nexpose Weinstein publicly, or tell him not to harass other women. From\nthe available accounts, he acted like a man protecting his property.</p>\n<p>Pitt is not the villain here, but the story, as it has been spun, is\ninstructive: this is how the conversation devolves from one about men\naccruing and abusing power over women to one in which men negotiate\nwhich women can be touched without fear of retribution.</p>\n<p>Nor is the fact of touching a body the most important part of the\nconversation. An extraordinary document of the current watershed of\nsexual-abuse allegations is a Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EllenPage/posts/10155212835577449\">post</a> by\nthe actress Ellen Page. The bulk of it is devoted to an incident that\ninvolved no physical contact. According to Page, when she was eighteen,\nthe director and producer Brett Ratner made crude comments about her in\nfront of other actors and outed her to the cast. He and his team\nallegedly proceeded to humiliate Page while also demanding her loyalty: at one\npoint, she says, she was instructed to wear a T-shirt with the words “Team Ratner” on it. Page, according to her account, was being taken hostage. (Ratner has not responded publicly to Page’s allegations.) In a single sentence in the sixth\nparagraph of the post, Page mentions being sexually assaulted by a crew\nmember—an event that she clearly sees as a\nconsequence of being dehumanized by much more powerful men. Her\nassailant had no reason to fear retribution. Conversely, if the crew\nmember were held accountable now, it would neither change the culture\nPage describes nor avenge her injury.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>As for Franken, there is something particularly disquieting about the\nsimilarity of his alleged actions, as described by Leeann Tweeden and\nacknowledged by him, to the behavior Donald Trump described in the\n“Access Hollywood” recording. But the more disturbing charges against\nTrump concerned women whose careers he controlled, such as the former\nMiss Utah Temple Taggart and the “Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos.</p>\n<p>Those cases illustrate the real issue here: the power imbalance that\nallows some men to take women hostage using sex. Franken, from what we\nknow, was not such a man. When he kissed Tweeden without her consent,\nduring a rehearsal on a U.S.O. tour, she was able to, according to her\ndescription, push her assailant away, tell him, “Don’t ever do that to\nme again,” and walk away—hurt and disgusted, to be sure, but not in fear\nfor her future. She\n<a href=\"http://www.kabc.com/2017/11/16/leeann-tweeden-on-senator-al-franken/\">wrote</a> that she didn’t go public at the time because she “didn’t want to cause\ntrouble,” and didn’t feel that she needed protection from Franken. On\nthe way back from the tour, Franken posed for a picture in which he\npretended to grope Tweeden’s breasts when she fell asleep on a plane.\nMore than a decade later, when Tweeden decided to go public, he\napologized. “The apology, sure, I accept it,” Tweeden said in a press\nconference. “People make mistakes.” She sounded less magnanimous than\nannoyed. She explained that she had decided to go public in order to\nencourage other women to speak up without fear. That matters. Whether\nFranken resigns does not.</p>\n</section></div></div>"}},{"layout":"featured_article","article":{"id":"5a0e134f72a27910fce00159","type":"post","name":"sections/culture/cover-story-2017-11-27","origin":"","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/sections/culture/cover-story-2017-11-27","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-20T10:00:00.000Z","issue_name":null},"toutImage":{"id":"5a0e14dc2c4e135599ca718c","title":"","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e14dc2c4e135599ca718c/master/w_1500,c_limit/CoverStory-blitt-thanksgiving.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e14dc2c4e135599ca718c/4:3/w_500,c_limit/CoverStory-blitt-thanksgiving.jpg"},"featured@2x":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e14dc2c4e135599ca718c/4:3/w_1000,c_limit/CoverStory-blitt-thanksgiving.jpg"}}},"ledeImage":{"id":"5a0e14e5bdc9984f9330e6b8","title":"","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e14e5bdc9984f9330e6b8/master/w_1500,c_limit/CVN_TNY_11_27_17RGB.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e14e5bdc9984f9330e6b8/4:3/w_500,c_limit/CVN_TNY_11_27_17RGB.jpg"}}},"blocks":[],"title":"Barry Blitt’s “Nowhere to Hide”","dek":"","description":"The artist discusses his cover for this week’s issue, which comments on the string of revelations of sexual abuse committed by powerful men.","rubric":"Culture","author":[{"id":"590a054bfba4e90c8d8d92df","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Françoise Mouly has been the art editor at _The New Yorker_ since 1993.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/francoise-mouly","email":"","name":"Françoise Mouly","socialMedia":[],"title":"Françoise Mouly has been the art editor at <em>The New Yorker</em> since 1993.","url":"contributors/francoise-mouly"}],"content":"<div class=\"article\"><div class=\"article-body\"><section></section><section><p>“The small figure depicted here is not specific,” Barry Blitt says, about his cover “Nowhere to Hide,” which comments on the seemingly endless string of revelations of sexual abuse committed by powerful men. “He could be any one of the parade of names that gets longer every day—from Harvey Weinstein to Roy Moore, Al Franken, Louis C.K., Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes, Bill Cosby, Kevin Spacey, and even the current occupant of the White House.

Certainly, what an anonymous buyer laid out last week at Christie’s for “Salvator Mundi” (circa 1500), a probable though to some degree only partial Leonardo da Vinci work that emerged from overpainted oblivion in 2005, seems a stuff fundamentally different from what you and I use to secure food and housing—or a yacht, even. It’s a cash Burning Man.</p>\n<p>Art is sometimes sentimentally termed priceless. But anything is priceless until someone sells it. Then there may be a clatter of the tote board for related items, pegging numbers up or down. The purely subjective rating of art works, which are all but devoid of material value, encounters no rational financial limit in either direction. The art market is a fever chart. Its zigs and zags call less for explanation than for diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Sentimentality has everything to do with the marketing of “Salvator Mundi.” A couple of factors seem involved in the exaltation of a dicey work, much damaged and the recipient of clumsy restorations before its recent rescue—to the extent possible—by an expert New York restorer, Dianne Dwyer Modestini. (Modestini painted the entire ivory-black background, guessing at the original look that had been lost when, at some point, it was partly scraped down to the walnut panel.) One inflationary circumstance is the soaring predilection of big money from Asia for touchstones of Western culture. With an apparent eye to China, Christie’s downplayed the Christian subject matter and content of the picture by tagging it “the male Mona Lisa.” Never mind religion. Think Renaissance superstar.</p>\n<p>A more general aspect of the mania is today’s global infatuation with technology, the source and the cult of newborn exorbitant fortunes. Leonardo was an eccentric sort of artist but a tinkerer beyond compare. The famous mysteries of his painting are achieved through wizardly experiments in chiaroscuro glazing. The undoubted inscrutability of the “Mona Lisa” skips the question of whether there was ever anything about the subject to, well, scrute. It’s a stunt, though a sublime one. Leonardo’s chief quality of personal affect—cold calculation—recommends him as the geek’s geek of all time. There is about him an air of an eternal twelve-year-old prodigy, smitten with warfare, natural disaster, and fantastic invention and twitchy about sex and other grownup preoccupations. His racing mind continually conceived grandiose projects that his immature will then let slide. The one thing he never ceased to do was to think, brilliantly.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The extent to which “Salvator Mundi” approaches the effective success of the handful of Leonardo’s masterpieces, among his fifteen or so surviving paintings, is up to each viewer. It looks wobbly to me. What kind of guy was Jesus? Every kind in reach of empathy, believers believe, and in comprehending the feminine as well. Giving an ambiguous character an ambiguous mien doesn’t seem a stop-the-presses innovation. The trick of it, by the way, is the same as that of the “Mona Lisa”: painting different expressions in the eyes and in the mouth. When you look at one, your peripheral sense of the other shifts, and vice versa. You try to reconcile the impressions, with frustration that seeks and finds relief in awe. This feature of the features does argue for Leonardo’s authorship—or auteurship, anyhow, if the handiwork that we see isn’t fully his own—despite some more or less plausible doubts that Jerry Saltz, in <em>New York</em>, ticked through, with entertaining zest, before the auction.</p>\n<p>Saltz assessed the picture as far beneath the standards of originality that Leonardo maintained for himself—not so much that the master didn’t create it but that he wouldn’t have. He cited, for one thing, the archaic, largely Byzantine convention of depicting Christ head on, delivering the usual raised-fingers blessing, at a time when Leonardo was doing wonders with figures turning in pictorial deep space—as with “The Virgin of the Rocks” and “Virgin and Child with St. Anne,” both at the Louvre. (And the “Mona Lisa” sits slightly angled toward a receding, immense landscape.) But I’m reminded of a spate of rampant challenges, in the nineteen-eighties, to the authenticity of many paintings accepted as Rembrandts, sometimes with reference to their relative quality, and of one authority’s defensive observation: “Even Rembrandt had Monday mornings.” Accordingly, I class my misgivings about “Salvator Mundi” as mere disappointment. While never quite loving any Leonardo, I’m conditioned to expect from him more terrific painterly ingenuities. “The Virgin of the Rocks” has made me laugh, from sheer marvelling.</p>\n<p>What got exchanged for nearly half a billion bucks at Christie’s wasn’t an art work. It was an attribution. The sale transferred a bragging right, padded with fatuous hype from well-qualified art people singing for their suppers, in a money-addicted system. Should anyone who isn’t invested in the game care? I don’t, long benumbed by such previous, now suddenly lesser, mockeries of sense and sensibility as the nine-figure hammer prices for a pretty good Modigliani, in 2015, and a second-tier Picasso, that same year. For anyone with intellectual, emotional, and spiritual uses for art, the spectacle might almost be happening on an alien planet populated by creatures with paddles attached to their arms.</p>\n<h2>The March of Genius</h2>\n</section><section><p>A word in the title of a magnificent show, “Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman &amp; Designer,” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, rings with telling archaism: “divine.” It derives from “il Divino,” a popular sobriquet for the Renaissance demiurge during most of his eighty-eight years on earth. Michelangelo’s sixteenth-century Italian contemporaries very nearly worshipped him for collapsing more than a millennium of distance between Classical antiquity and a surge of avowedly Christian but disruptively individual inspiration. Along with his elder Leonardo da Vinci and his junior Raphael—both of whom he competitively detested—Michelangelo sowed the arts of religion with the seeds of a virtual religion of the arts: a forward march of geniuses, each in turn remaking the world. From the triumph, when he was twenty-nine, of his sculpture “David,” he became his own first follower, as an architect of St. Peter’s Basilica and the doyen of perfervid Mannerism in painting and sculpture. His works, however pious in theme, chiefly advertise Michelangelo as God-touched. This poses a problem in taking his measure. It is hard now to use the word “divine” in conversation, or even to think it, except facetiously. But you can’t miss the atavistic power in this show’s hundred and thirty-three drawings, which are beautifully installed with a few of his creations in sculpture, painting, and design, and with works by related artists.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The drawings are stupendous—no surprise—though strikingly limited in iconography and formal repertoire, except those from a few years when Michelangelo exercised a definitively Mannerist panache in gifts to friends and patrons. In a smoky portrait dated 1531-34, the hauntingly ambiguous expression of an adored young friend, Andrea Quaratesi, qualifies the sitter as kissing kin of the Mona Lisa. And three renderings of “The Fall of Phaeton” (1533)—the flying charioteer shot down by Zeus—establish forever what horses would look like when plummeting from the sky. Otherwise, muscular male bodies predominate. So does workaday service to sculpture, in studies rather than pictures: hard contour lines popping images off the paper. The effect is exhaustingly repetitive. How many times in a row can you swoon to marks that sound the same chord of rippling anatomy? The artistry never fails, but your stamina will. This may get you, like me, to musing philosophically about an artist whose status as the most universal of masters can seem to balance, like an inverted pyramid, on this or that straining bicep. It’s a glory and a vexation. To behold Michelangelo’s work is perforce to be hyperconscious of his performance.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/5a0db12bd0df0a47c2a078a6}}--></div><p>Michelangelo could be archly ironic, in his poetry and an occasional bit of cartooning, but is never funny. This is rare among great artists, who palpably comprehend the absurdities of displacing reality with artifice, even as they do no less. (I can think of only one more insistently humorless: Mark Rothko.) God’s animating touch to Adam on the Sistine Chapel ceiling is the artist’s own, bifurcated between giver and receiver. The tag “il Divino” conveys the sole appropriate positive response to such temerity: surrender. The effect alternates between desperately moving and a pain in the neck—not only literally, when you crane for views of the ceiling, but psychically, always. Just one quality, the humblest, makes Michelangelo reliably tolerable: workmanship. He chose the most difficult art, stone carving, as his specialty and took on labors to make Hercules faint, such as a monumental tomb for Pope Julius II that occupied him for forty years. The Met has reproduced the Sistine ceiling with an overhead light-box photograph, at one-fourth scale. That’s a travesty, aesthetically, but it provides useful reference for mapping the destinations of several preparatory drawings.</p>\n<p>The ceiling was a job of interior decoration, undertaken in 1508 and completed in 1512. (The end-wall mural, “The Last Judgment,” was added more than twenty years later.) Michelangelo filled the bill, with rhythmic iterations of color—notably orange against blue—which startled everybody when the frescoes were cleaned, three decades ago. He was a klutz at painting in rectangular formats, which went against his figure-intensive grain by requiring edge-to-edge unity. The eccentric shapes of the Sistine coffers eliminated that obstacle; each snugs around a bespoke image in illusory sculptural relief. Is the result the best work of art ever made? We can’t say, because nothing compares to it. But many of the studies—such as the red-chalk Libyan Sibyl, twisting forward with her arms reaching behind her to close a book—are as consummate as any marshalling of an eye and a hand by an imagination can be. The Sistine opus yields a faint sense of what it must feel like to be God, jump-starting humanity, programming its significance, and then, with “The Last Judgment,” closing it out. We will never get over Michelangelo. But we will also never know quite what to do with him, except gape.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>At the Met Breuer, a modern master of late-blooming reputation receives recuperative, gorgeous attention to his least esteemed body of work. “Edvard Munch: Between the Clock and the Bed” takes its title from the last of the Norwegian’s major self-portraits—or “self-scrutinies,” as he termed them. Completed a year before his death, in 1944, at the age of eighty, it pictures a wizened man standing in semi-silhouette against the bright yellow of a studio wall that is hung with indistinct paintings. There’s a faceless grandfather clock to one side of him and, to the other, a bed with a spread that is rendered in a bold pattern, on white, of red and black hatch marks. The painting crowns a long period that began after 1908, when an alcoholic breakdown ended Munch’s twenty-year streak as a peripatetic rock star of Symbolist sensations—life-changing then and ever since for many, including me—of which “The Scream” (1893) is only the most celebrated. After treatment at a Danish clinic, he withdrew to a nearly reclusive existence in a house outside Oslo. He left off distilling iconic images from his tumultuous experience in favor of painting, non-stop, whatever appealed to him on a given day: himself, landscapes, interiors, models, and repetitions (rather spunkless) of his early masterpieces, such as “Madonna” (1892), a lover’s-eye view, during intercourse, of a woman who is supremely indifferent to him. The old elixirs of angst and eros bubble up now and then, but tangentially; mainly he was absorbed in moving paint around in his impulsive, whiplash, kinetic manner. There has been a tendency, which I’ve shared, to disparage the late work as a slackening of the artist’s halcyon intensity. I still feel that way, while ready to acknowledge that Munch would rank high in art history even if these paintings were all we had of him.</p>\n<p>In odd effect, the show claims a place for Munch in the modernist canon of painting for painting’s sake, which once marginalized, as vulgar, his specifying of emotional content in dramatic subjects. It presents the spectacle of a great visual poet reduced to unstructured, though lyrical, painterly prose. Munch’s elevation over the past half century (saluted by the market, in 2012, with a hundred and twenty million dollars paid at auction for an 1895 version, in pastels, of “The Scream”) has marked the baby-boom generation. Like the insurrection of rock and roll against show tunes and sugary popular music, Munch’s touchstone images came to satisfy a yen for something grittier and more urgently engaging than the formalism, based in Impressionism and Cubism, that was upheld by art historians at the time. His sensibility suited a generation convinced that it had invented sex, in the sixties, and the pleasures and panics of narcissism, in the seventies. “Between the Clock and the Bed” coincides neatly with the impending boomer discovery of death. (We will then mercifully get off the world’s nerves.) But that seems far from the curators’ intention.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>“Self-Portrait with Cigarette” (1895) is the show’s best representation of the echt Munch: the artist as an anxious dandy in a choking nocturnal atmosphere. That it is beautiful amazes, with aesthetic detachment tensed against naked emotion. You aren’t being shown what the artist was like. Rather, you effectively become him as you look. His courage dumbfounds. It persists, however vitiated, throughout the show, invoked by every turn of his wrist, with expression that states something, be it only a whim, that is felt to be true. But the experience conveyed—a sleepless night, perhaps a sexual imbroglio with a model, a memory of a former theme—becomes the occasion, no longer the point, of a picture. The older Munch took to working for himself alone until, with “Self-Portrait Between the Clock and the Bed,” he came upon one new fact of his life, incidentally relevant to everybody, that was worth getting just right. It’s a feat both in and beyond art: a threshold of eternity. ♦</p>\n<!--{{/galleries/5a0f85b9ce93fc4120fd2e60}}--></section></div></div>"}},{"layout":"featured_article","article":{"id":"5a0f44f2d0df0a47c2a07b29","type":"post","name":"culture/culture-desk/after-abuse-the-possibility-of-a-better-man","origin":"","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/after-abuse-the-possibility-of-a-better-man","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-19T18:23:06.907Z","issue_name":null},"toutImage":{"id":"5a0e032ecf6a92080ac92a2d","description":"A Better Man","title":"","caption":"The filmmaker Attiya Khan, pictured during her teen years with a man identified in her new documentary only as Steve, who was violent toward her throughout their relationship.","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e032ecf6a92080ac92a2d/master/w_1500,c_limit/A-Better-Man.png"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e032ecf6a92080ac92a2d/4:3/w_500,c_limit/A-Better-Man.png"},"featured@2x":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e032ecf6a92080ac92a2d/4:3/w_1000,c_limit/A-Better-Man.png"}}},"ledeImage":{"id":"5a0e032ecf6a92080ac92a2d","description":"A Better Man","title":"","caption":"The filmmaker Attiya Khan, pictured during her teen years with a man identified in her new documentary only as Steve, who was violent toward her throughout their relationship.","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e032ecf6a92080ac92a2d/master/w_1500,c_limit/A-Better-Man.png"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0e032ecf6a92080ac92a2d/4:3/w_500,c_limit/A-Better-Man.png"}}},"blocks":[],"title":"After Abuse, the Possibility of “A Better Man”","dek":"The premise of Attiya Khan’s startling new documentary is her reunion with the former boyfriend who used to beat her.","description":"The premise of a startling new documentary is the reunion between a filmmaker and the former boyfriend who used to beat her.","rubric":"Culture Desk","author":[{"id":"5910a75c2e2e17730741c6f7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Doreen St. Félix is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

During the documentary’s seventy-three intense\nminutes, they jointly exhume their disastrous two-year relationship as\nteen-agers, when he violently abused her. Together, they visit a\ndomestic-violence counsellor, as well as the apartment they shared and\nthe high school they attended, spaces where Steve inflicted humiliation\nand pain upon Khan. Simply looking at the buildings’ exterior façades\ncauses Khan to become nauseated and, in the Ottawan winter, flushed with\nupset.</p>\n<p>“A Better Man” nominally belongs to a certain set of interrogatory\ndocumentaries in which an aggressor and a victim convene to reach some\nsort of breakthrough: the itinerant child who makes peace with the\noppressive parent; the career racist who, upon looking into the saucer\neyes of the benevolent black man, renounces the activities of his clan.\nThe ethos of these documentaries is rooted in the idea that social\nproximity might coax those inclined to dehumanize certain members of the\npopulation into quick enlightenment. Sometimes, the results are less\nthan feel-good; the draw of “Angry, White and American,” a recent\n<a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/angry-white-and-american\">program</a> for which the black journalist Gary Younge interviewed the white\nnationalist Richard Spencer, was, essentially, lurid juxtaposition. In\nMarch, an Icelandic motivational speaker,* Thordis Elva, provoked\ninternational outrage by collaborating on a book and a <em class=\"small\">TED</em> Talk tour\nwith Tom Stranger, the man who raped her when she was sixteen years old.\nTo many, the value of Elva’s pragmatism—that reconciliation may put to\nflight the spiritual inertia brought upon a victim by trauma—was\nundermined by the exculpatory glamour that the commercial tour lent to\nStranger.</p>\n<p>No such glow illuminates Steve (he has kept his surname private, at\nleast for the time being), who onscreen is often palpably uncomfortable,\nsquirming, trembling, whimpering, whispering. Watching a conversation in\nwhich Khan asks Steve, as he visibly turns pale, whether he remembers\nthrowing her on the ground in their flat and punching her, I felt a\nvicarious satisfaction washing over me; as he answered yes, sounding and\nlooking small and timid, that satisfaction thinned to zero oxygen. But\n“A Better Man,” despite its title, is not concerned with turning Steve\ninto a better version of himself. Instead, the film seeks to portray him\nas he is, however agonizing his normalcy may be. More than once, Khan\npresses him on the abuse that he may have endured before they started\nliving together, instinctively attempting to place him in some cycle of\nviolence; Steve vaguely confirms that there was trouble but does not\ndivulge specifics. The documentary’s cleverness is that it resists the\nroundness of resolution or catharsis, while also acknowledging that Khan\nand Steve will always remain some kind of asymmetrical unit.</p>\n<p>A montage of weathered photographs of Khan and Steve, who met as\nstudents in Ottawa when she was sixteen and he was seventeen, depicts\nthe two grinning, their cheeks pressed together. Khan, now forty-three,\nhas, except for the faint silver in her hair, barely changed; Steve’s\npunk hair has been shorn, and now he wears glasses. After Khan ended the\nrelationship, the two repeatedly ran into each other in Toronto. During\none of these encounters, Steve apologized. This encouraged Khan, who\nwent on to work with people who have suffered domestic abuse and\nassault, to float an opportunity to him, in 2013. It took six months for\nSteve to agree to film both their conversations and their sessions with\nTod Augusta-Scott, a counsellor. In total, they spent eight days\ntogether over the course of a year. Sarah Polley (the actress and\ndirector of the documentary “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/20/only-human-3\">Stories We Tell</a>”) is the executive producer\nof “A Better Man”; the cinematographer is Iris Ng; Khan co-directed the\nfilm, along with Lawrence Jackman. That so many women are in charge of\nthe movie is all the more remarkable given that their storytelling has a\ntherapeutic dimension for Khan.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>In her interactions with Steve, Khan mostly inhabits the professional\nstance she has developed as an abuse counsellor. You can sense her\nsoftening her voice, calculating what her body language should\ncommunicate, measuring the physical distance between herself and Steve\nas they sit, drive, and walk. The cadence of her questions resembles\nthat of Augusta-Scott, whom the two meet separately and together. “Do\nyou remember the frequency of the abuse?” Khan asks Steve in one of\ntheir first sessions. They are sitting at a coffee table; Khan leans in.\nSteve’s shoulders slump. “No,” he says, “I just know that it wasn’t\ngood.” Throughout their meetings, Khan recalls the minutiae of his\nhorrific assaults, as if the episodes are replaying before her, at one\npoint describing Steve throwing one of the few trinkets she owned\nagainst a wall and then dragging her over its glass shards. Sometimes\nSteve remembers, and sometimes he doesn’t. It’s not that he ever denies\nKhan’s accounts; rather, the violence, for him, seems to have dissolved\ninto the churn of his volatile youth. This is the epistemological crisis\nof abuse, in which the burden of knowing and remembering falls on\nvictim. Late in the film, Khan, in a voice-over, expresses anger at this\ncruel imbalance: “How could you not remember abusing me every day in\nthat house? I needed you to be the one to say it.” Her question recalls\nthat crucial\n“<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/924848412842971136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">if</a>”\nthat has qualified the recent public admissions of guilt from so many\npowerful men—and those awkward codified phrases we have heard so often\nof late: “my abuser,” “my rapist.”</p>\n<p>At times, Khan’s agitation sneaks through. “I hate that one. I just hate\nit,” she says to Augusta-Scott, about her memory of the time Steve put\nher in a sleeper hold. You can hear Steve gulp when Augusta-Scott asks\nif he remembers. (“I do now,” Steve answers.) At one moment, as we watch\nKhan receive acupuncture, she tells us, again in voice-over, “You had a\nthousand ways of saying how I deserved to be hit, spit on, made fun of,\nbecause I was brown.” The charge of her words was familiar to me. Since\nthe <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories\">Harvey Weinstein</a> story broke, I’ve had what seems like hundreds of\nconversations with black and brown people, who feel a suppressed rage at\nthe contours of the current reckoning. For hundreds of years, it was not\npossible to rape a black woman, in a legal sense, because she was not,\nlegally, a woman; our national image of victims of assault, of victims\nin general, is terminally white and female. Some feminist circles\ntacitly argue that putting racial abuse on the same psychic plane as\nphysical abuse is a distraction; Khan articulates the seamlessness\nbetween the two.</p>\n<p>The framework of “A Better Man” perhaps owes less to those gimmicky\nfilms that dramatize confrontations than to restorative justice, or R.J.\nThe approach has increasingly come up in conversation, as those outraged\nat powerful men’s abuses realize that firings and cultural\nexpulsions—which remain, however momentous, exceedingly rare—constitute\na reaction more than a reparation. R.J. is an alternative to the\ncarceral approach, drawing from aspects of indigenous-community\npractices in which victims, their communities, and wrongdoers together\ndecide what should be done to repair a harm. Kimberlé Crenshaw’s\ncritical essay “Mapping Origins,” from 1991, defines part of its appeal\nfor women of color, among whom there is “a more generalized community\nethic against public intervention, the product of a desire to create a\nprivate world free from the diverse assaults on the public lives of\nracially subordinated people.” But some critics of R.J. have argued that\n“cheap justice” can embolden abusers: an empty show of remorse is how\nsome people retain their power. Khan recently told an interviewer that\nshe wasn’t familiar with restorative justice before she started to make\nher documentary, which is careful to avoid advocacy—and part of the\nstrength of “A Better Man” is that its tone is both hopeful and dubious\nabout the potential of that model. Steve, for one, is uncommonly\nwelcoming to the prospect of being confronted and documented, but he\ndoesn’t seem to grasp that there might be something that these exchanges\ncould give to Khan. “I really just want you to be O.K., and I don’t know\nwhere you are with that,” he says, in their last meeting. To call this\n“healing” may overstate how trauma interrupts daily life; sometimes, we\njust continue.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Perhaps the release of “A Better Man” would always have felt\ncoincidental. It has come out during a peak of awareness about the\nprevalence of assaults against women, but that should not undermine the\nfact that this film was, for Khan, the work of twenty years. Since her\nrelationship with Steve, she has grown older, found a partner, had a\nson. These two people flit in and out of the documentary, reminders that\nlife goes on; one scene shows them giving out white ribbons, a display\nof support for women who have been abused, to male shoppers at a grocery\nstore.

Perhaps a friend has brought you,\nor maybe hearing one of the band’s songs on FM radio has drawn you\nthere. Regardless, you’re in luck. You’re catching AC/DC at the perfect\nmoment, as it’s on the cusp of transforming itself into a musical\njuggernaut. The group, hailing from Australia, has just released\n“Powerage,” a forty-minute distillation of swinging, aggressive rock and\nroll that Keith Richards will later say is his favorite AC/DC album. In\na matter of months, the band will record “Highway to Hell” and, soon\nafter that, “Back in Black,” which will become the sixth-best-selling\nalbum of all time.</p>\n<p>So, what do you notice? Up front and hard to miss is Angus Young, the\ndiminutive dynamo of a lead guitarist, wearing the sweat-soaked remains\nof a velvet schoolboy uniform, duck-walking and thrashing his head like\nthe lightning-strike victim on the cover of “Powerage.” Nearby, prancing\nbare-chested, is the lewd and mischievous lead singer, Bon Scott. (He’ll\nbe dead by the end of the decade.) But, if you can take your eyes off\nthese two showmen for a moment, you might find your gaze drifting to the\nleft of the drum riser, where a pugnacious long-haired kid (he looks like\nhe’s still in high school), wearing jeans and a white T-shirt, is\nstrumming his Gretsch guitar and shaking his leg in time to the driving\nbeat. His name is Malcolm Young, and you could be forgiven for seeing\nhim as just another part of the backing band, but he is in fact the\nmastermind of the whole operation, at once its visionary and its\ntaskmaster. He is the soul of the band, its leader on and off the\nstage.</p>\n<p>Malcolm, who founded AC/DC with his younger brother Angus, in 1973, died\non Saturday at the age of sixty-four, succumbing to the dementia that\nhad first manifested nearly a decade ago. He had not performed with the\nband since 2014, when the condition became so disabling that he was no\nlonger able to play the immaculate hard-rock songs he had helped to\nwrite. (His nephew Stevie Young replaced him on the road.) Malcolm’s\npassing comes a month after the death of his older brother George, a\nmember of the nineteen-sixties Australian hitmaker the Easybeats. In\naddition to mentoring Malcolm and Angus in the art of songwriting,\nGeorge helped foster in them a distrust of the business side of the\nmusic industry. AC/DC was a notoriously insular family enterprise, one\nwhose inner workings often seemed veiled and capricious.</p>\n<p>But there is no questioning the brilliance of the formula that George\nand his longtime songwriting partner, Harry Vanda, helped nurture in\nMalcolm and Angus: a rigorous fidelity to the musical tradition\nestablished by Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, coupled with the volume and\npropulsive force of hard rock. The hybrid resulted in sales of more than\ntwo hundred million albums and a decades-long career as a top-grossing\nlive act. Many bands tried to emulate AC/DC; few came close to equalling\nthem, in part because few could match the sheer musicianship that the\nYoungs brought to the task. “It’s harder than it looks,” sang Bon Scott\nin “It’s A Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock ‘n’ Roll),” and the\nYoungs always made it look easy. For his part, Malcolm saw the members\nof the Rolling Stones as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHXZ1ZqY3jA\">his only true\npeers</a>.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Mark Evans, who played bass for AC/DC in the nineteen-seventies, once\nwrote that Malcolm was “the driven one . . . the planner, the schemer,\nthe ‘behind the scenes guy,’ ruthless and astute.” There was a dogged\nconsistency to AC/DC’s songwriting, which stemmed directly from\nMalcolm’s stated unwillingness to change. This spared the band’s fans\nfrom having to put up with the experiments that other groups engaged\nin—collaborations with classical musicians, or investigations of music\nfrom other cultures. You knew what to expect, and AC/DC always\ndelivered. But, as the members of the group aged (with Brian Johnson\nreplacing Scott as vocalist), the roguish, rebellious songs that formed\nthe core of their legacy—songs with titles such as “Problem Child,”\n“Hell Ain’t a Bad Place to Be,” “Riff Raff,” and “You Shook Me All Night\nLong”—came to seem more and more removed from the graying men who sang\nthem.</p>\n<p>My AC/DC obsession began in the late nineteen-seventies, right around\nthe time I was reading the works of S. E. Hinton in middle school.\nThough Angus always dressed like a delinquent English schoolboy onstage,\nMalcolm struck me as having walked straight out of the pages of “The\nOutsiders.” He was a Greaser itching for a chance to rumble with the\nprivileged Socs. It’s that scrappy, committed presence that stays with\nme. A special kind of self-confidence and self-awareness is required to\nembrace the undersung role of rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist,\nceding the limelight to your brother, but he correctly saw that this was\nthe best distribution of their talents.</p>\n<p>The interplay of Malcolm’s and Angus’s guitars is the essence of AC/DC’s\nsound. You can hear it if you listen closely to almost any of their\nsongs. A favorite of mine is\n“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSVvqpjWCxg\">Overdose</a>,” from “Let\nThere Be Rock,” released in 1977. The song opens with a series of\narpeggios played on a single guitar, almost like a warm-up exercise.\n(It’s uncharacteristic of the band to have left such a rough intro in\nthe final edit.) Drums soon arrive, adding some structure, followed by a\nthrumming bass line, and then the second guitar, with a striking,\nunforgettable riff. The other guitar shifts to playing open chords\nbefore finally locking in on the riff with the first. Lars Ulrich, of\nMetallica, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/metallicas-lars-ulrich-on-his-15-favorite-metal-albums-w485547/acdc-let-there-be-rock-1977-w485557\">singled the song out</a> earlier this\nyear, noting that AC/DC almost never performs “Overdose” live. Thus, it’s hard\nto know which brother plays which part of that intro. One thing’s for\nsure, though: the song, like the band, wouldn’t work with only one of\nthem.</p>\n</section></div></div>"}}]},{"name":"The Latest","items":[{"layout":"thumbnail_with_timestamp","article":{"id":"5a13170a8796e321f1f8b1ae","type":"post","name":"podcast/comment/tests-for-liberals","origin":"The Latest","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/comment/tests-for-liberals","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-20T18:07:03.854Z","issue_name":null},"toutImage":{"id":"5a0f7041930f3430042202be","description":"Illustration by Roman Muradov","title":"171127_r30992illuweb","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0f7041930f3430042202be/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_r30992illuweb.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0f7041930f3430042202be/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_r30992illuweb.jpg"},"featured@2x":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0f7041930f3430042202be/4:3/w_1000,c_limit/171127_r30992illuweb.jpg"}}},"ledeImage":null,"blocks":[{"type":"image","id":"/photos/5a04e1eecbb1980903cfb5e2","description":"Illustration by Tom Bachtell","title":"171120_r30963illuweb","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a04e1eecbb1980903cfb5e2/master/w_1500,c_limit/171120_r30963illuweb.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a04e1eecbb1980903cfb5e2/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171120_r30963illuweb.jpg"}},"attributes":{}}],"title":"Tests for Liberals","dek":"","description":"Amy Davidson Sorkin writes about Al Franken, Roy Moore, and a test for the Democratic Party.","rubric":"Comment Podcast","author":[{"id":"5909ff44c14b3c606c109ec5","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"_The New Yorker_ offers a signature blend of news, culture, and the arts.

the era of professional Instagram\ninfluencers, but there was a time, not too long ago, when many ordinary\npeople just . . . <em>had blogs</em>. From about 2002 through 2006, once the Internet\nhad stopped being the exclusive province of people with real technical\nexpertise, and right before the dawn of widespread social-media use,\nWordPress and Movable Type made it possible for civilians with only a\ntiny bit of HTML at their fingertips to launch their own small\npublications. They wrote about bands and books and their love lives,\noften with no real goal beyond recording their daily existences. Some of\nthese people managed to garner real readerships. One of them was Deb\nPerelman, a New Jersey native living in New York City, who, in 2003,\nstarted a blog to write about her bad dates. After meeting the man who\nwould become her husband, she pivoted to writing about her domestic\nlife, especially cooking and eating. Eventually, she named the blog\nSmitten Kitchen.</p>\n<p>Today, almost all of the personal blogs that began in the early aughts\nare gone, but Smitten Kitchen remains. Not only does it remain: it\nthrives; it grows. Simultaneously, it retains both editorial\nindependence and Deb’s unmistakable funny earnestness. Her mission is\nthe same as it’s been for many years: to make recipes as good as they\npossibly can be. Her tone has remained essentially unchanged since her\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060813111441/http://www.smittenkitchen.com:80/\">first tentative\npost</a>,\nabout the glory of “the damp spot on top of a ripe tomato when you twist\nthe vine off. It smells like summer to me, back when tomatoes came free\nfrom our backyard and not at surprising sums from Holland.” Smitten\nKitchen, these days, is not just a food blog: it is <em>the</em> food blog,\nwhat many people think of when you say those words. And now, with the\npublication of Deb’s second cookbook—“<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smitten-Kitchen-Every-Day-Triumphant/dp/1101874813/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511042927&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=smitten+kitchen+every+day&amp;dpID=51jjUk5MuUL&amp;preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch\">Smitten Kitchen Every\nDay</a>”—it\nis poised to take Deb into the realm of her lodestars, the Inas,\nMarthas, and Nigellas she jokingly writes about imagining herself to be.</p>\n<p>I have, full disclosure, been a part of the same blog-generation as Deb\nlong enough to have had many lovely e-mail and Twitter interactions with\nher, and also to have once met her in person (an occasion on which I was\ncompletely starstruck). But most of my disturbingly encyclopedic\nknowledge of everything S.K.—the way Deb’s recipe-making mind works, her\nfamily dynamics, her likes and dislikes—comes from being a longtime\nreader, and from having cooked and eaten probably hundreds of her\nrecipes. She’ll write something like “The second I had these ingredients\ntogether—lemon, tahini, butternut squash, garlic, chickpeas—I couldn’t\nbelieve it was the first time,” and I’ll suddenly be convinced that I\nneed to make a <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/01/warm-butternut-squash-and-chickpea-salad/\">warm butternut-squash\nsalad</a> for dinner. I love the work of many other food writers, but there’s no\nother cook with whom I’ve achieved quite this level of one-sided\nintimacy. And I’m not some outlier weirdo here! To prove it, I asked a\nfriend who has also been an S.K. reader since the beginning to quickly\nlist five things she knows about Deb’s palate. She responded in seconds:\n“1. Doesn’t do fish. 2. Will fritter anything. 3. Thinks of crepes as an\neasy make-ahead food 4. Not hugely into spicy food 5. Isn’t afraid to\nrework a complicated recipe or dumb down ingredients from a traditional\none.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>This is pretty much the same list I’d make, though I’d never noticed the\ncrêpe detail, and I’m inclined to give Deb credit for trying to become\nmore fish-curious. But I’d add another item, and probably list it first:\nthe enduring backbone of the S.K. aesthetic is that Deb is a\nrecovering vegetarian who sees meat as a form of seasoning. She\ndefinitely doesn’t think it’s a requisite part of a complete meal. This\ncontributes to the over-all affordability of cooking the S.K. way,\nsomething that other cookbook authors seem not to take into account when\ndevising their recipes, unless they’re specifically writing about cooking\non a budget. Deb assumes, rightly, that almost everyone is on a budget,\nand builds frugality into her recipes in small but welcome ways. She\nwill never ask you to use a tiny amount of a big-ticket item that only\ncomes in large quantities, for example. She has genuine love for beans,\ngrains, eggs, and tofu. In this sense, her cookbooks are a part of the\nlegacy of Mollie Katzen, who popularized hearty, mushroomy vegetarian\nmain dishes in her “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Moosewood-Cookbook-40th-Anniversary/dp/1607747391/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\">Moosewood Cookbook</a>” and its sequels.</p>\n<p>Everyone I know who cooks has a favorite S.K. recipe. From the new book,\nI already have a few keepers, and many that I’ve bookmarked to try. I love it\nwhen Deb tries to replicate the humble, takeout-y foods of N.Y.C., which\nshe somehow manages to do without being gimmicky. Her at-home halal-cart\nchicken, complete with copious “white sauce,” provides all the primal\nsatisfaction of the original, and she has unlocked the secret of the\ncarrot-ginger dressing that comes on sushi-bar salads, which I will\nalways think of as Dojo dressing, after the wallet-friendly restaurant\nnear N.Y.U. (The secret: white miso.) I also can’t wait to try a few of\nthe weirder-sounding dishes, like “caramelized cabbage risotto.” Deb\nreally, <em>really</em> loves cabbage. She explains that this is because she\nwasn’t served it growing up, and thus never developed an aversion: she\nloves it “with the open-hearted abandon of someone who chose it.”</p>\n<p>Such is Deb’s power: I trust her when she tells me that something called\n“sesame-peanut pesto” is worth getting out the Cuisinart for, and that I\nshould serve “loaded breakfast potato skins” at my next brunch. I know\nthat Deb isn’t padding with filler to reach a page count or to churn out\ncontent; her commitment to the recipes she creates is evangelical and\nabsolute.

Were you there then?</em></p>\n<p>I was between deployments and in Utah for most of that time. My job\nwhile deployed was to direct air strikes, so I’d train on bombing ranges\nall over the state. In addition to refamiliarizing myself with the\ngeometry and pacing of an attack, I’d reacquaint myself with the\ntargeting gadgetry: laser, G.P.S., infrared, and radio. These things\ntook very precise measurements of the target location. It seemed,\nhowever, that the more precise the measurement was the less certain I\nbecame of the target’s location. Sometimes, I’d get so far down in the\nweeds that nothing seemed fixed. And it wasn’t until I’d leave one range\nfor another—driving on the interstate for fifty miles east or west, with\nthe desert speeding by on either side—that things would settle down\nagain.</p>\n<p><em>The story revolves around a troop of American soldiers at an outpost in\nLogar Province, who don’t have a mission or any intelligence to pursue\nand have to invent missions for themselves. Would that ever happen?</em></p>\n<p>While I was deployed, our intelligence was very good, so mission\nplanning typically consisted of connecting a few well-defined dots. On\nthose rare nights when the dots weren’t completely filled in, or didn’t\nexist at all, we’d have to extrapolate. Our mission was to hunt H.V.I.s,\nor high-value individuals. We’d take into account each individual’s\nso-called patterns of life. These were his habits, faults, and\ndesires, converted into something like vectors. Occasionally, those\nvectors would triangulate. I wouldn’t call that process inventive,\nnecessarily, but there was a creative element to it.</p>\n<p><em>The narrator imagines his troop as abandoned or suspended in time—like\nthe Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima who hid underground for months,\nunaware that the war had ended—or else killed on the spot by an\nasteroid. Is he afraid of these possibilities or is he, in a way,\nfantasizing about them?</em></p>\n<p>I think it’s more projection than fantasy. The narrator wonders how the\nwar will end for him, and, if he survives, what life will be like\nwithout it.</p>\n<p><em>There’s a certain lawlessness in this troop: we think of these men as\ndecent people, but, at the same time, the final mission they choose has\nsome moral ambiguity to it. I assume that’s intentional?</em></p>\n<p>That fictional lawlessness has roots in reality. Of all the men and\nwomen who join the military seeking discipline, very few become true\nbelievers in it. Most, I’d say, simply figure out how to get by, while a\nvery small minority learn how to weaponize their more chaotic\ntendencies. These are the ones who gravitate toward special operations.</p>\n<p><em>The American men’s relationship with Joe, their Afghani-British\ntranslator, is a complicated one, isn’t it? The narrator seems somewhat\nirritated by Joe, and his constant proximity, and yet Joe is the only\nperson who tries to alleviate the guilt that he feels for the role he\nplayed in his fellow-soldier Yaz’s death.</em></p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>My guess is that Joe’s attempt to alleviate the narrator’s guilt annoys\nthe narrator, too. I’d say he doesn’t want to let himself off the hook\nthat easily.</p>\n<p><em>“The Lost Troop” will be part of your collection, “Bring Out the Dog,”\nwhich comes out in March, and some of the characters here reappear in\nother stories in the book, including\n“<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/11/kattekoppen\">Kattekoppen</a>”\nand “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/crossing-the-river-no-name\">Crossing the River No\nName</a>,”\nwhich were also published in The New Yorker. Was it always planned as a\nstory collection, or did you think about writing about this group of\nsoldiers in novel form?</em></p>\n<p>Whatever plans I made while writing this book were repeatedly undone,\nand the resulting frustration would throw me off for months. I’d have to\nlaunch some unrelated project in order to get back on track. So I\nrebuilt the engine in my truck, and I dug up and replaced all the\nsprinkler lines in my back yard. These tasks lent themselves to planning:\nI could set a goal, make progress toward it, and take stock at the end\nof the day. I could enjoy the satisfaction that comes from physical\nexhaustion. Eventually, I’d go back to writing. My only plan toward the\nend was to try to capture the weirdness.</p>\n<p>*Do you have any favorite war stories by other writers? *</p>\n<p>My benchmarks are Donald Barthelme’s “The Sergeant,” Isaac Babel’s\n“Squadron Commander Trunov,” and Barry Hannah’s “Midnight and I’m Not\nFamous Yet.” I know I’m onto something, writing-wise, whenever Hannah’s\nnarrator starts reading my words back to me.</p>\n</section></div></div>"}},{"layout":"thumbnail_with_timestamp","article":{"id":"5a0dbfb14a74a44b79017acb","type":"post","name":"sections/cartoons/cartoons-from-the-november-27-2017-issue","origin":"The

All weekend, energy buzzed\naround both “The Daily”—which has made great contributions in 2017 to\naudio journalism and to our collective sanity—and its gentle, bearded\nhost, Michael Barbaro. After panels and at cookie breaks between\nworkshops, people approached him a bit giddily. (One guy I talked to\ndescribed him as having the “posture of a superhero.”) That morning,\nBarbaro took the stage and leaned over the lectern, saying, “Here’s what\n<em>else</em> you need to know today.” There were appreciative laughs. He\ndescribed the highlights in store for us that evening: an awards\nceremony, an after-party. “There will be an actual red carpet at this\nevent—and there will be dancing,” he said, in careful, sober tones.\n“Finally, lunch today will be build-your-own tacos. I’m Michael\nBarbaro.” More jollity. Theme music accompanied him offstage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/explore/person/johanna-zorn\">Johanna Zorn</a>,\nThird Coast’s executive director and co-founder, was a producer and\ndirector at the public-radio station WBEZ for thirty years. In 2001, she\nstarted the conference because she wanted to foster and celebrate great\naudio documentary work, with the goal of creating a kind of Sundance for\nradio. The 1993 audio documentary “<a href=\"https://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/explore/feature/ghetto-life-101\">Ghetto Life 101</a>”\nwas one of her inspirations. In that piece, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/simple-powerful-war-stories\">Dave Isay</a>,\nnow best known as the founder of <a href=\"https://storycorps.org/\">StoryCorps</a>,\ncollaborated with <a href=\"https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/from-ghetto-life-101-to-politics-101-lealan-jones-senate-green-party/Content?oid=2634112\">LeAlan Jones</a>,\nthirteen, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/09/us/graduation-ends-a-partnership-born-in-a-chicago-ghetto.html\">Lloyd Newman</a>,\nfourteen, on a sound diary of their lives in housing projects on the\nSouth Side of Chicago. (In the beginning, we hear barking. “This is my\ndog Ferocious,” Jones says, amiably.) “I would never have that\nopportunity, to inhabit a thirteen-year-old boy’s life,” Zorn told me.\n“But I just did.” She saw this kind of audio as journalism in the\ntradition of the Chicagoan Studs Terkel: “interviewing everyday people,\nstaying away from the celebrities and the stars and letting us walk in\npeople’s shoes.”</p>\n<p>That impulse coincided with the rise of another force in Chicago\njournalism and audio: “<a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/\">This American Life</a>,” which Ira Glass began in\n1995. By the early aughts, the world of high-quality audio nonfiction\n“was sort of growing and contracting at the same time,” Zorn said. <a href=\"http://www.prx.org/\">PRX</a>, the Public Radio Exchange, and <a href=\"https://transom.org/about/about-transom/\">Transom</a> came along,\nconnecting people and offering resources and training, and producers\nwere excited about the form and its possibilities. “There was this\nsensibility out there—a lot of potential,” Zorn said. “But at the same\ntime there was a contraction in terms of outlets and money.” During the\nfirst years of Third Coast, Zorn said, “It was a very niche community.\nAnd people were sad because in the early days of ‘All Things\nConsidered,’ to get a twenty-three-minute documentary on in the\nafternoon was becoming harder and harder. There were fewer outlets, and <a href=\"https://www.cpb.org/\">CPB</a>,”—the Corporation for Public\nBroadcasting—“which had been giving grants to documentary work, wasn’t\ndoing it anymore. There was this feeling of fewer and fewer\nopportunities, a caving in of the options.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>In those years at Third Coast, she said, “We were doing the best we\ncould to broaden it when there weren’t as many outlets—bringing in\ninternational people, more youth reporters, finding any which way.” The\nconference was held every two years for a while. Gradually,\ntechnological and financial shifts changed the climate and began to meet\nthe potential that had been building all along among talented\npractitioners. “Every step of technology that has happened since Third\nCoast has been better for audio,” Zorn said. With the Internet and\ndigital recording, she said, “anyone could make work anywhere—you didn’t\nhave to have the keys to the studio.” With iPods, smartphones, and\npodcasting, “it’s just gotten easier and easier for people to create and\npeople to listen.”</p>\n<p>Cars, too. “I call them radio hostage machines,” Maya Goldberg-Safir,\nThird Coast’s artistic associate, said.</p>\n<p>Longtime attendees described Third Coast to me as a “group hug” and a\n“family reunion,” where independent producers and people from far-flung\npublic-radio stations connected and reconnected over the years. It has\nproduced marriages (<a href=\"https://thirdcoastfestival.org/explore/feature/accidental-gay-parents-episode-5\">Hillary Frank</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mashupamericans.com/listen/podcast-ep-44-hillary-jonathan-sitting-tree/\">Jonathan\nMenjivar</a>),\npartnerships that led to shows (“<a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/\">Radiolab</a>,”\n“<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/invisibilia-evolving-art-radio\">Invisibilia</a>”),\n<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/nocturne-the-podcast-that-explores-the-night\">collectives</a> (<a href=\"http://www.theheardradio.com/\">the Heard</a>), and many other\nconnections. As it has helped shape the industry in the past couple of\ndecades, it’s also reflected it. Julie Shapiro, Third Coast’s co-founder\nand the executive producer of the Radiotopia podcast network, told me\nthat in 2011, when “Love + Radio” ’s “The Wisdom of Jay Thunderbolt”\nwon the festival’s gold award, people were amazed that a podcast had\nwon. Then, in 2014, podcasts changed everything. That fall, Third Coast\nhad “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/serial-podcast-weve-waiting\">Serial</a>”\nfever like everyone else. Goldberg-Safir told me, “Lauren Ober from ‘The\nBig Listen’ got onstage and said, ‘Who thinks that Adnan did it?’ ” The\nroom went crazy, voting and debating. After “Serial,” when podcasts blew\nup, Third Coast expanded, too. “More and more people with more and more\nenergy,” Zorn said. “More people coming to discover talent. More\nsponsors. Everything dialled up.”</p>\n<p>“ ‘Serial’ literally created jobs for people,” Goldberg-Safir said.</p>\n<p>Before that moment, Zorn said, “People’s name tags would stay the same\nfor ten years. People were kind of stuck.”</p>\n<p>“And this year we were getting calls, like, the day of the conference\nfor a title adjustment,” Goldberg-Safir said.</p>\n<p>“The mobility is a really good thing,” Zorn said. “We saw it in\ntelevision and I feel like we’re mimicking it in radio.”</p>\n<p>This year, the range of attendees, veterans, heroes, and newbies was\nbroad. We were a massive crowd, milling around the glassy, carpeted\nconference spaces in a Hyatt by Lake Michigan. We wore lanyards around\nour necks, printed with our names, our affiliations, and our gender\npronouns. To a newcomer, it felt like a cozy, supportive,\noverstimulating new world. To help foster connections, each name tag, on\nthe back, had a sticker bearing the name of a kind of tree—your small\npeer group. Sometimes, while trying to scope out a name, you’d encounter\na tree instead: <em class=\"small\">ELM</em>, <em class=\"small\">DOUGLAS FIR</em>. When people said critical things, they\nsaid them with sly glee. “Being at Third Coast is all about talking shit\nabout people’s mike quality,” a producer said to me, looking pleased\nwith her devilishness.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Hosts and producers from many of the year’s biggest and best podcasts\nwere there, among them Al Letson, of\n“<a href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/\">Reveal</a>,” Nigel Poor, of “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/ear-hustle-the-podcast-made-inside-san-quentin\">Ear Hustle</a>,” Dan Taberski, of “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/missing-richard-simmons-and-the-queasiness-of-deep-dive-entertainment-journalism\">Missing Richard Simmons</a>,” Tally Abecassis, of “<a href=\"http://firstdaybackpodcast.com/\">First Day Back</a>,”\nBrian Reed, of “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/s-town-investigates-the-human-mystery\">S-Town</a>,”\nJonathan Goldstein, of “<a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/heavyweight/\">Heavyweight</a>,” Jad Abumrad and\nSean Rameswaram of “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/more-perfect-where-radiolab-meets-the-supreme-court\">More Perfect</a>.”\nI talked to producers, composers, entrepreneurs, podcast-network\nexecutives. I talked to a college student who carried a recorder with\nher everywhere, making audio stories for her family and friends; a woman\nwho had switched careers, in midlife, from magazine publishing to audio;\nand a veteran who’d decided to get into broadcasting in the eighties,\nwhen he heard an ad similar to ones I remember from my childhood in\nConnecticut—“Have you ever considered a career in radio?”—and has worked\nin it ever since. I talked to fellow-members of a fledgling group that\nthe boom has helped foster—people who write about podcasts. Among them:\nNick Quah, of the invaluable “<a href=\"https://www.hotpodnews.com/\">Hot Pod</a>,”\nand members of the <a href=\"https://bellocollective.com/\">Bello Collective</a>.\nPeople observed that the world of audio journalism, still booming three\nyears after “Serial” débuted, feels a bit like the Wild West.</p>\n<p>Part of this Wild West is a growing canniness about money. The creator\nof an earnest human-interest show told me about new two projects he’s\nexploring, both involving a business-minded partner and major brands,\nwhich would combine subjects of cultural interest with big names and\nbroad commercial appeal. I spoke to people who made branded podcasts;\nGimlet and Pineapple Street make several. The world of celebrity\npodcasts is expanding, too. With commercialism, and the mixed impulses\nthat accompany it, come concerns. One industry veteran I talked to was\ntroubled by the fact that the host of a popular show reads ads in a\nstyle that makes it hard to discern from the show itself; here and\nthere, you’d hear candid criticisms about the possible erosion of\njournalistic standards, of ethical concerns about true-crime podcasts\nand armchair-detective podcasts. Several people fretted to me about\n“<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/dirty-john-journalism-as-noir-entertainment\">Dirty John</a>,”\nfrom the L.A. <em>Times</em> and Wondery, whose tone and content, as well as\nits jarring murder-themed ads, made people uneasy.</p>\n<p>At the awards ceremony, hosted by the British podcaster Helen Zaltzman,\nof “<a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/\">The Allusionist</a>,” the public-radio values of reporting,\nfact-checking, empathy, and new voices telling their own stories were\nrewarded with Oscars-like fanfare and statuettes shaped like radios.\nPeople were dressed in their public-radio finest, which ranged from\ngowns to hoodies. One winner, “<a href=\"https://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/explore/person/noel-anaya-10-04-17\">Emancipation: A Young Man Leaves Foster Care on His Own Terms</a>,” by Noel Anaya and Brett Myers, was being talked about all weekend, as\nwas Anaya, who was also a feisty and endearing panelist. I was\ntremendously moved by another winner, “<a href=\"https://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/explore/feature/majds-diary-two-years-in-the-life-of-a-saudi-girl\">Majd’s Diary: Two Years in the\nLife of a Saudi Girl</a>,”\nwhich deftly gives us a window into one young woman’s experience of life\nin Saudi Arabia. In her acceptance speech, the appealing Majd Abdulghani\nreminded us that hers was just one story—not the story of every Saudi\ngirl. The Minnesota Public Radio podcast “74 Seconds,” about the killing\nof Philando Castile, won the Best Documentary: Gold Award, for its\nepisode “<a href=\"https://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/explore/feature/traffic-stop\">The Traffic Stop</a>.” It’s a must-listen.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>“I’m really curious about what will happen,” Zorn said, about the\nevolving field of audio journalism and the commercialism that comes with\nit. Gimlet, Pineapple Street, Audible, and other for-profit networks are\n“broadening the kind of storytelling” that’s being created, so far with\ngood results. “I think that the New York <em>Times</em>, which we forget is\ncommercial—they are for-profit!—did a fabulous job with ‘The Daily,’ ”\nshe said. Print is shrinking, she said.</p>\n<p>At times, I had an unnerving feeling that the thrill of the audio\nmoment, the giddiness about “The Daily” (which I share), and the\nshrinking of print were all uneasily connected. As <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/an-appreciation-of-michael-barbaro-and-the-daily\">Rebecca Mead wrote</a> earlier this year, “In Barbaro’s hands—or, rather, in Barbaro’s\nvoice—the <em>Times</em> becomes conversational and intimate, instead of inky\nand cumbersome.” In an era that feels more fast-paced and anxious than\never before, that holds enormous appeal.</p>\n<p>After the awards ceremony, Sean Rameswaram, of “More Perfect,” who had\nthat day led a sharp, funny session about writing and delivering audio\ncopy that makes you sound like yourself, became a d.j. at the\nafter-party. In a hangarlike brewery space tricked out like a disco, at\nan event thrown by RadioPublic, which shone its logo on one wall,\nRameswaram spun records and danced to them—Missy Elliott, Beyoncé,\nOutkast—along with everybody else. It was an ecstatic, sweaty scene, and\nits joy seemed to reflect the state of the industry. A couple of days\nlater, we learned that Rameswaram, too, was getting a title change: he’s\ngoing to Vox, to host its upcoming daily-news-explainer podcast.</p>\n</section></div></div>"}},{"layout":"featured_article","magazineStartPage":46,"article":{"id":"5a0c61df5ec78f4aefa92a6b","type":"article","name":"magazine/2017/11/27/a-mexican-town-wages-its-own-war-on-drugs","origin":"Spotlight","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/a-mexican-town-wages-its-own-war-on-drugs","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-20T10:00:00.000Z","issue_name":"November 27, 2017 Issue"},"toutImage":{"id":"5a0df1fa32e52953cc4d2b48","description":"Photograph by Ian C.

Nearly all were indigenous farmers, and their skin was burnished by the sun. Most carried guns. The group’s coördinator, a slim man with a mustache named Bernardo Ayala, laid his cell phone on a table, put it on speaker, and called their leader: Nestora Salgado, a grandmother of five who lives outside Seattle.</p>\n<p>“Hello, commander,” Ayala said. “All of the <em>compañeros</em> are here.” Salgado greeted them, her voice echoing in the courtyard, which was decorated with shrines to Catholic saints. In person, Salgado, who is forty-five, has dark bangs that sweep over a cherubic face with kohl-rimmed eyes; she has a cheery disposition and a deceptively guileless manner. Since 2012, she has divided her time between Washington State and Guerrero, where she was born, in the hope of helping her town resist an influx of drugs and violence.</p>\n<p>For more than a decade, the Mexican government has been waging war against organized crime, deploying tens of thousands of troops. That war has failed; more than a hundred and fifty thousand people have been killed and another thirty-two thousand have disappeared. Amid the violence, the government forces have often been no less venal and corrupt than the drug cartels they were dispatched to fight. In many places, citizens have grown so distrustful of the security forces that they have formed armed community self-defense groups to restore order to their battered towns.</p>\n<p>In less than a year, Salgado transformed a group of untrained local citizens into an armed force that was able to track down and arrest kidnappers and murderers. Its success helped inspire a surge of community police; of eighty-one municipalities in Guerrero, fifty-four now have forces. But the group, founded with the intention of fighting criminals, had ended up fighting the Mexican government as well. In 2013, Salgado was arrested, and authorities accused her of murder, kidnapping, organized crime, and robbery. After almost three years in prison, she was cleared of charges, but many of her colleagues still had open arrest warrants. The force, which at one point had two hundred and forty volunteer officers, was down to eighty, and they were struggling to keep working.</p>\n<p>“Does anyone have questions for Nestora?” Ayala asked the group.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0f38fd930f34300422017e}}--></div><p>“<em>Compañera</em> Nestora, the thing that has most stopped us is that we don’t have any money to operate,” a heavyset man named Calixto Reyes said. “We pay for everything out of our own pockets and from whatever people give us. And there are many communities that have requested our support.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Salgado urged them not to give up. “The government is trying to stop our work,” she said. “But we have to continue.” As the community policemen prepared to begin the night’s patrol, she signed off. “I would like to send a very strong hug to all of you,” she said. “We will stay in touch.”</p>\n<p>Ayala began chanting the group’s motto: “Respect for our rights—”</p>\n<p>The others joined in: “Will bring justice!”</p>\n<p>Ayala said, “<em>Vámonos, compañeros</em>,” and the group walked to two white trucks, emblazoned with the community-police insignia. They eased their vehicles down a near-vertical road into town, past kids nestled in doorways and shopkeepers closing down businesses. Most offered friendly greetings. A slender man with graying hair flagged them down. “There are some guys racing on motorcycles here,” he said, waving at the street, which was wide enough for only one lane of traffic. “They’re using the street as a drag strip. If you see them, please get them to calm down.”</p>\n<p>Around another corner, the community policemen encountered a group of young people with a red motorbike, but they turned out not to be the culprits. “If that was the motorcycle, we would have just taken it,” Julia Silva, one of two women on patrol that night, joked. “We need them for rapid response.”</p>\n<p>A municipal-police truck passed, and turned down a parallel street. One of the men looked at the vehicle with disgust. “The police,” he said. “Whenever they see us out, then they remember they have a job to do.”</p>\n</section><section><p>Olinalá is a modest place of nine thousand people, with sloping streets, a scenic plaza, and the reddish spectre of mountains looming in the distance. The town is known for its ornate lacquerware, and the mountains for fields of poppies. Mexico is the world’s third-largest producer of opium, and Guerrero grows fifty to seventy per cent of the country’s poppies; the mountains near Olinalá are among the most productive regions. When Nestora Salgado was growing up there, the drug trade was negligible, and the town was poor but safe. “It was beautiful,” Salgado said. “My family, my friends, everything was there.” Surrounded by six siblings and many aunts, uncles, and cousins, she felt that she was related to almost everyone. Her family lived in an adobe house with a tin roof on a vast farm, and she was free to roam. Though her mother urged her to “behave like a little woman,” she preferred to go horseback riding and shoot birds with her brothers. She often came home with bruises and a bloody nose.</p>\n<p>Salgado’s mother, Aurora, had come to Olinalá from a nearby indigenous Tlapanec village. “People were very discriminatory toward indigenous people,” Salgado said. “It’s why she didn’t teach us to speak her language. She thought that if I spoke it people would laugh at me.” Aurora hadn’t gone to school, but she was intelligent and resourceful. She taught herself to sew clothes and to make cookware; in addition to taking care of the children, she helped with planting and harvesting crops. Salgado’s father, Fernando, a playful, easygoing man with deep-blue eyes, worked as a farmer and a practitioner of traditional medicine. He housed patients at the farm while they recuperated, giving them food and a place to sleep.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>When Salgado was twelve, her mother died, of a heart attack, and her father started disappearing on drinking binges, sometimes for a week at a time. Not long afterward, Salgado began spending time with a friend named Miguel, the first boy she ever liked. He was funny and friendly, and within a few months they married. She was fourteen and he was nineteen. “My father looked at me like I was crazy,” she said. “My husband was very scared. He thought my father wanted to hurt him.” She moved to Miguel’s family farm and soon had a daughter, Saira. Miguel wouldn’t allow her to return to school, but she didn’t mind. “I played like a little kid at their house,” she recalled. Things became harder, though, as she had two more daughters, Ruby and Grisel. There was very little work outside the farm, and barely enough money to buy milk for the children. “We had nothing,” Salgado said.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0f38fd4a74a44b79017c6f}}--></div><p>Miguel sometimes went to the United States for stints of work, but Salgado never saw the earnings. “I would be waiting for him, for him to send money to us,” she said. “I think he was drinking a lot.” So, at nineteen, she headed to the border, leaving her daughters with her sister in Mexico City. “It was very hard to leave them,” Salgado recalled. She had nightmares of her daughters drowning. Salgado had to cross illegally, running across fields and highways. She was captured, and sent back to Tijuana by bus. She tried again the next day, and, this time, she made it to San Diego. During the crossing, though, she lost Miguel’s phone number. “I didn’t know how I would find my husband,” Salgado recalled. “I was scared and didn’t know what I was going to do.” She thought of going home, but she owed money to her coyote—the smuggler who had helped her cross. A woman who worked for the coyote, providing meals for the migrants, hired Salgado as a nanny for her young children.</p>\n<p>After three months, Miguel found her, and the two moved to Bellevue, Washington, where a cousin of his lived. Miguel worked as a dishwasher. Salgado found a job as a housekeeper at a hotel, and another at a dry cleaner. “I remember waking up in the mornings and going to work happy,” she said. “Walking the streets, I saw everything as beautiful—the plants, the flowers. Olinalá doesn’t have any parks. I wanted my daughters to see this.” After a year, she had saved enough money to bring their daughters to Bellevue. But she had to hire a babysitter while she was at work; Miguel couldn’t be relied on to watch the children. Salgado would come home to find her husband drinking with his friends, the kitchen empty of food for their daughters. Once, the sheriff came to her house to put their belongings outside because they hadn’t paid rent. “The terrible thing was that I saw my husband not worrying about anything,” she said. Miguel physically abused her so viciously that he was eventually sent to prison.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>At twenty-six, she finally left him. She got a job as a waitress, and at the restaurant where she worked she met a cook from Jalisco named José Luis Ávila. “My life changed,” Salgado said. Ávila helped her with her children and the rent. They got married, and eventually moved to Renton, a small city near Seattle. In 2001, she obtained a residency card, and, ten years after leaving Olinalá, she was able to return for a visit. “Everyone was so happy,” she said. “But I was also sad, because I saw how truly poor my town was.” Salgado began going back every year, bringing children’s toys, clothes, and other donations she had collected in Washington. Her daughters didn’t like the town, which seemed too foreign, too small, too quiet. To Salgado, it was paradise. She gardened, farmed, and rode horses; on an undeveloped part of her father’s land, she began building a house.</p>\n<p>Yet the area was becoming increasingly unrecognizable. For years, the Beltrán Leyva cartel had controlled Guerrero’s opium production. But, starting in 2009, the government killed or arrested most of its leaders. With the Beltrán Leyvas gone, and with U.S. demand for heroin rising, more than a dozen gangs began a fierce struggle for raw material and transport routes. Their members committed kidnappings and murders; they took over the commerce of towns, and then forced residents to pay taxes to them.</p>\n<p>The government was little help. Mexico’s then-President, Felipe Calderón, had sent a surge of troops to the region, but the presence of the military often intensified the violence. Local forces were no better. Mike Vigil, a former Drug Enforcement Administration chief of international operations in Mexico City, told me, “The municipal police were endemic with corruption.” The drug trade had saturated the government with corruption, and few politicians evaded it. “You can count them on one hand, the ones who are clean,” Salgado said. Leaked government documents from 2014 assert that state security knew of at least twelve mayors in Guerrero who were connected to organized crime. “This is the true nightmare: that the enemy, the Mafioso, who is tearing society apart, goes unnoticed in public office,” Anabel Hernández wrote in the book “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Narcoland-Mexican-Lords-Their-Godfathers/dp/1781680736\">Narcoland</a>.” Guerrero became one of the most violent states in Mexico, with thousands of killings each year. During my visit, security forces found six decapitated bodies in a car in the state capital and four tortured corpses in another town. “A lot of people were scared, but no one said anything,” Salgado said. “You can’t live like that.”</p>\n</section><section><p>In the fall of 2012, Salgado’s father fell ill, and she went to Olinalá to care for him. She found the town besieged by <em>sicarios</em>, or hit men, connected to the Los Rojos gang. Salgado told me that they operated freely on the streets, shooting guns at all hours of the day. They kidnapped a hotel owner and extorted money from shopkeepers. A mother of three told me that, after months of paying protection fees, she closed her shop. Illicit business proliferated: the sale of bootleg liquor and cigars, stolen cars and animals. “The police wouldn’t do anything,” Bernardo Rosendo, who runs an art school in town, told me. The <em>sicarios</em> acted with such impunity that some townspeople began to believe that the mayor, Eusebio González Rodríguez, was tolerating their presence. (González denied this, saying, “I have always done things within the law.”)</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>In the month before Salgado arrived, at least three people had been murdered. That October, during her visit, a taxi-driver named Cecilio Morales was kidnapped. A group of people, including her brothers, went looking for him, and finally found his body near a ravine, his head smashed in with a rock. “People were really angry,” Salgado recalled. At the funeral, the next morning, rumors spread that another driver from the town had been kidnapped. “We were fed up,” Tomás Bello Flores, a community policeman, told me.</p>\n<p>People gathered in the central plaza, where the town’s church stood amid trimmed shrubs and palm trees. A few residents rang the church bell, and hundreds more came to the square to find out what was going on. “That was the moment that started the movement,” Salgado said. “I was planning how we could work together to defend ourselves.”</p>\n<p>Some residents had grabbed one suspected criminal and turned him over to the police, but he was quickly released. “We realized the police were not going to do anything,” Juan Guevara Ayala, a corn farmer and an uncle of the missing driver, recalled. As the sun was setting, Salgado and the other townspeople stopped a police truck near the plaza, and forced the policemen to get out and turn over their guns. “I felt I was in God’s hands,” Ayala said. “Whatever would happen would happen.”</p>\n<p>For the next two hours, Salgado drove the truck through town, shouting through a megaphone, “Come out! You don’t have to be scared!” People started organizing by neighborhood, and, armed with AK-47s and hunting rifles from home, and sometimes wearing ski masks, they set up checkpoints to monitor who was coming in and out of town. “The streets were packed,” Ayala recalled.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/5a0f3950ae84d238abda6798}}--></div><p>More than a hundred townspeople headed to a house where several of the <em>sicarios</em> lived, to make them reveal the whereabouts of the second driver. The men were gone when the group arrived, but the townspeople found a car and two motorcycles, and torched them. A few days later, one man called Salgado and reported that a group of men had detained the <em>sicarios</em>’ teen-age girlfriends. Furious, they wanted to take them to the plaza, douse them in gasoline, and burn them. “I hurried over there,” Salgado said. “I said to them, ‘What are you doing?’ ” She told them that killing the girls would just create trouble. Instead, she suggested questioning them. They had worked as lookouts for the <em>sicarios</em>, and as prostitutes for the men.</p>\n<p>The next day, they picked up the girls from their family homes and took them to a school, where they had arranged for a lawyer to be present. The girls told them whom the <em>sicarios</em> were planning to kidnap (Salgado was on the list) and whom they were working with: wealthy residents of Olinalá, the head of local government security, the public prosecutor, and the mayor. (The officials deny working with the <em>sicarios</em>.) They showed cell-phone videos of executions that their boyfriends had committed, and of children being sexually abused. Salgado and the others put the footage on disks to keep as evidence.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>In the <em>sicarios</em>’ home, they discovered shotguns and bulletproof vests, along with a cache of driver’s licenses from various states in Mexico, declaring that the men belonged to several branches of the armed forces simultaneously. Before the townspeople left, Armando Patrón Jiménez, the town’s public prosecutor, came to collect the items. He and Salgado had been friendly for years, occasionally going for drinks together, but the timing of his arrival made her suspicious. “Why?” Salgado said. “How did he know those things were there?” (Patrón Jiménez says that he was there as part of a routine investigation, and denies that there were weapons.)The following week, the governor of Guerrero, Ángel Aguirre Rivero, came to Olinalá, and Salgado gave him a disk with the footage from the girls’ cell phones. “I said, ‘That’s why my town needs community police,’ ” she recalled. “And he said, ‘Oh, yes, yes—that’s very good. I am proud of you for wanting to provide security for your people.’ ” But neither he nor the military attempted to arrest the <em>sicarios</em>. Instead, the governor later supplied the community police with trucks and uniforms, and recognized Salgado as head of the force. She was forty-one years old, and had recently become a grandmother. “He said the security of the town would now be in my hands,” she said.</p>\n</section><section><p>Guerrero has a long history of indigenous revolt. The Sierra Madre del Sur was often the site of protests against Spanish colonists and post-independence Presidents. Since then, leftist guerrilla movements have proliferated in the region, even though the Army has tried to extinguish them, through extrajudicial killings, abduction, and torture. In the seventies, the schoolteacher turned revolutionary Lucio Cabañas lived in the mountains and led a guerrilla group that waged a rebellion for the poor; they supported themselves through bank robberies and other crimes against the wealthy and the state. More recently, indigenous communities have organized grassroots protests against environmentally hazardous infrastructure projects and the incursion of mining companies on their land.</p>\n<p>Salgado’s force grew out of a civilian police organization called Coordinadora Regional de Autoridades Comunitarias-Policía Comunitaria. <em class=\"small\">CRAC</em>-P.C., as it is known, was founded, in 1995, to provide security in the place of hapless or disinterested police and military. It is sanctioned by Guerrero State Law 701, which recognizes the authority of indigenous communities to administer themselves, “based on their ancestral customs and traditions that have been transmitted for generations, enriched and adapted with the passage of time.” Law 701 also permits a judicial system “for the prevention and resolution of conflicts” and “to reduce crime, eradicate impunity, and rehabilitate and reintegrate social transgressors.” It endorses the idea of collective justice, which is valued in many indigenous Mexican communities. Under the law, towns with indigenous and mestizo residents can reconcile perpetrators and victims in accordance with traditional methods; the community police formed institutions called <em>casas de justicia</em>, which tried people for minor crimes.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Salgado’s new force was made up of farmers, ranchers, engineers, doctors, accountants, and teachers, mostly of indigenous descent. Boys under eighteen could join if they were married. When Salgado became leader, some men bristled, but she offered her position to anyone who wanted it, saying that she would be happy to be just a community policewoman. No one came forward. “Nestora has more balls than anyone in this town,” Bernardo Ayala said.</p>\n<p>Olinalá has eight neighborhoods, and Salgado helped arrange for the community policemen to patrol each one at night. Each policeman took a couple of shifts a week. Salgado patrolled every night, from nine o’clock until two o’clock, driving her pickup with policemen in the bed. Her neighbors donated food, water, trucks, and gas money to her force, and brought hot coffee and tacos while they patrolled.</p>\n<p>Many nights, Salgado’s force simply insured order on the streets: taking drunks home, driving sick people and pregnant women to the hospital. Other work was more serious. They rescued residents who had been abducted, and arrested people whom they suspected of robbery, kidnapping, or extortion. Salgado received phone calls from people threatening to kill her. “A lot of the time, they didn’t have a face,” she said. “They were ghosts.” Still, the patrols gave her a rush. “We knew that if these people were able to get us they would tear us to pieces,” she said. “Fear can make you react, or it can flatten you. I am someone who reacts.” When she called her family in Washington, she kept the details of her new life vague; she didn’t want them to worry.</p>\n<p>One afternoon, during her first month leading the force, an eight-year-old boy disappeared from a nearby town. His father, a butcher, received a phone call three hours later: the boy had been abducted, and his kidnappers wanted two million pesos. The parents were afraid. After realizing that they could not come up with the money, they called their town’s community police—“No one trusts the municipal police anymore,” Salgado said—who then called community forces in the surrounding towns. Salgado and thirty of her men joined a search party of community police and residents, looking in abandoned houses and ranches, amid the weeds and the cornfields. One of the searchers, looking near a farm a two-hour drive from town, heard suspicious sounds, and alerted the community police. They found the boy there; the men guarding him had fled. “I was scared, because I knew the <em>sicarios</em> were close and could kill us, but I was happy to see the boy,” Salgado recalled. The kidnappers were later arrested.</p>\n<p>Law 701 places few limits on the authority of community police, saying only that they need to operate within “the framework of respect for human rights” and “the limits that the current state of law imposes.” In practice, the state authorities expected them to act as adjuncts of the municipal police. But Salgado and her men felt increasingly confident in their parallel system of justice. Community police forces were reluctant to turn prisoners over to the government, because officials sometimes allowed suspects to buy their way out of jail. In Olinalá, Salgado’s force kept detainees on the top floor of her house, which doubled as her office. “We would just guard them,” Gustavo Patrón Coronel, a sixty-six-year-old artisan and community policeman, said. “They were allowed to receive visitors, they were fed—very much like a regular jail.” After the community police investigated an offense, the victim was invited to face the accused in Salgado’s house, and if the latter confessed reparations were arranged. “Everything had a structure,” Salgado said. When an agreement couldn’t be reached, she sent detainees to a <em>casa de justicia</em>, which decided whether to impose “reëducation”—a period in which prisoners lived in basic facilities while they attended talks and performed public works, like picking up trash, painting churches, and cleaning schools.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0f38fd2ec1303c9b4acbdd}}--></div><p>Although community police were legally restricted to small rifles, at times they carried higher-calibre weapons, some of them bought from soldiers selling surplus arms. “I carried a gun that was not permitted,” Salgado said—a .38 Super pistol. “If the military had found it, they would have taken it away.” She wore a bulletproof vest and practiced point-blank shooting. “We told the government, ‘We’re not going to war with slingshots. Respect our lives, because our lives mean something, too,’ ” she went on. “The government wanted us to have sticks, and our enemies can take down helicopters.”</p>\n<p>By the spring of 2013, Salgado was working to organize community police forces throughout the state. “All the towns within indigenous territory can, within the law, organize themselves,” she said. “Every eight days, a town would rise up.” In May, the governor’s office dispatched a former <em class=\"small\">CRAC</em>-P.C. coördinator to tell Salgado that the government didn’t like the way the <em>casas de justicia</em> were operating and wanted her to limit her work to Olinalá; Salgado said that he offered her three million pesos to stick to small matters, such as stolen cattle and family disputes. (The governor declined to comment.) She refused, saying that the network of towns helped keep the roads safe. “The government never left us alone,” Bernardo Ayala recalled. “It was constant harassment.” The security forces intimidated them as well. “We received direct threats from the Navy,” Juan Ayala Rendón, a community policeman, said. “They told us that they were going to kill us, that they were going to disappear us, that they were going to arrest us.”</p>\n<p>Rather than back away from antagonizing officials, <em class=\"small\">CRAC</em>-P.C. became more aggressive. When a resident called Salgado to complain that municipal policemen were driving recklessly through town, she and her men located the chief of police and two officers, who were drunk and carrying alcohol. They arrested the officers, and confiscated their guns and their truck. They sent a message to the mayor, but heard back that he didn’t consider it his problem. (The mayor says that the officers assured him that they weren’t drunk; in any case, he says, the governor was responsible for the municipal police.) The next day, representatives from the state government came to collect the policemen, and then returned for their arms and their vehicle.</p>\n<p>Around that time, four of the teen-age girls who had been involved with the <em>sicarios</em> began disappearing for days at a time, and their mothers came to <em class=\"small\">CRAC</em>-P.C. for help finding them. In late May, Salgado received a message that the girls had been found in two nearby towns, with cocaine and marijuana on them; she arranged for community policemen to bring them home. Their mothers told Salgado that she should put them in reëducation, but some members of the community force’s internal council were wary, because the girls were underage. Salgado told the mothers that they would need to give written permission. The women provided it, and Salgado took the girls to the town La Concordia to live at a convent and perform community service.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Ten days later, Salgado recalls, one of the mothers returned to her office and said that the mayor had offered her money to accuse Salgado of kidnapping her daughter. González denied the bribe, saying that he was responding to concerns in the community. “These were minors who were detained, and the pressure was on me, because their families were asking me, ‘You, as mayor, what are you going to do?’ ” he said. “I had to go to the state government. It was a serious matter, because unauthorized firearms were being used, and I had doubts about the legality under which they were operating.”</p>\n<p>The next week, two of the mothers returned to the office and said that they wanted to take their daughters home, which Salgado allowed. When she was later arrested, the warrant claimed that she had unlawfully detained the teen-agers. “I was part of the recognized state security,” she said. “But the mayor was working with the governor to put me in jail.”</p>\n</section><section><p>In August, 2013, two men from Olinalá were murdered near the border with the neighboring town of Cualác. The victims were known as criminals, but they were still members of the community, and their relatives wanted their bodies returned.</p>\n<p>The community policemen learned that police in Cualác had taken the bodies to a nearby town, Huamuxtitlán, and went to retrieve them. “We all got together—there were forty or fifty of us in three vehicles,” Patrón Coronel recalled. “But the bodies were already gone.” The public ministry in Huamuxtitlán told them that the bodies had been sent on to the state capital; all that remained was the victims’ truck, riddled with bullet holes, which was being held at a local impound lot. When the community police arrived, they found Armando Patrón Jiménez, the public prosecutor, already there, along with two other men. Salgado says that they had set fire to papers in the truck, and were trying to push a cow that had been recovered from the dead men’s vehicle into the bed of another truck. One of the community policemen recognized the branding on the cow; it had been stolen from his family ranch a few days earlier. Salgado confronted the prosecutor and said, “What are you doing?”</p>\n<p>Salgado says that Patrón Jiménez had no ownership papers, which people typically carry, because cattle rustling is pervasive. She asked why he was burning evidence, but he didn’t respond. “You know what?” Salgado said, gesturing at the three men. “Take them away.” Patrón Coronel told me, “I was very nervous arresting Jiménez. But he was claiming something that was not his.” As Patrón Jiménez shouted at Salgado’s men, calling them brutes, they put the suspects in their truck and drove them to a nearby jail. (Patrón Jiménez denies destroying evidence and stealing the cow; he maintains that the two dead men had recently bought the animal, and that he was collecting it to return to their families. “She was a friend,” he said, of Salgado. “Now she is perverse, a psychopath.”)</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The governor called almost immediately to order Salgado to release Patrón Jiménez. She refused, insisting that he was guilty of attempted theft and tampering with crime-scene evidence. “Nestora was always fearless; she was always running around alone, even though we told her to move with ten or twelve guys,” Juan Guevara Ayala, a community policeman, said.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0f38fd2a4e1876fb328621}}--></div><p>Salgado was due to return to Renton the following weekend, but, before she could leave, military personnel spotted her at a gas pump and arrested her. Several other members of the community police force from Guerrero were also arrested. José Luis Ávila, Salgado’s husband, learned of her detention later that day. “When you have family working against organized crime, you expect something to happen,” Ávila, who has a buzz cut and a salt-and-pepper mustache, said. “But I thought, Why was she arrested?” Relatives in Mexico scrambled to obtain news of her. “All we knew was that she had been taken by soldiers,” Ávila went on. “The government kept hiding information.” After a day or two, he called the American Embassy in Mexico and found out that Salgado was in a maximum-security prison in Nayarit, more than six hundred miles from Olinalá.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t going to live by the law of the jungle,” Governor Aguirre said at the time. “They can’t go around armed, from one town to the other. They can’t make arrests for major crimes. When they detain someone, they have to turn them over directly to the proper authorities. . . . She refused.”</p>\n</section><section><p>At first, Salgado did not even know what the charges against her were. For months, she was kept in a ten-foot-square cell with stark-white walls and a bright light that remained on all night. She ate her meals alone and forced herself to drink the dirty water from the tap. Later, her lawyer secured permission for her to go onto the patio, but she was not allowed to talk to the other inmates. Salgado thinks that the prison authorities were afraid she would organize them. She has lingering pains in her arms and legs, the result of a car accident, a decade ago, that left her temporarily paralyzed; she relies on medication to manage her discomfort, but she was unable to get it. “I suffered a lot in prison because of the pain,” she said.</p>\n<p>In May, 2015, Salgado went on a hunger strike, restricting herself to water, lime juice, and honey. After thirty-four days, authorities consented to move her to the medical wing of a low-security facility in Mexico City, and she began to eat again. “I survived, thank God,” Salgado said. Still, Ávila was unable to visit her. “We had to make hard choices, because of the money,” he said. “I am the one who had to keep working. It was easier for my daughters to go and visit Nestora.” Ávila travelled instead to Washington, D.C., to meet with congressional staff members, asking them to push the State Department to intervene in Salgado’s case. In those meetings, Ávila tried to convey his wife’s commitment to her home town. “So many people from Mexico, they come to the United States and they truly forget where they come from,” he said. “Thank God Nestora is not one of them. She’s a very strong woman.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The charges against Salgado eventually included organized crime, vehicle theft, homicide, attempted homicide, and fifty-three counts of kidnapping. Roberto Álvarez, a Guerrero state-security spokesman, suggested to me that much of <em class=\"small\">CRAC</em>-P.C.’s work was illegal. “They were not arrests—they were detainments. And, in the reëducation process, the liberty of the detainees was taken away,” he said. “The community police would ask the families of the detainees for money in exchange for their freedom.” Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission found that the community policemen in Olinalá had subjected twelve prisoners, including four minors, to physical abuse and inhumane treatment, denying their “right to personal integrity, dignified treatment, sexual freedom, and the right to a life without violence.”</p>\n<p>Salgado’s first two lawyers, one state-appointed and the other from the indigenous-rights organization Tlachinollan, had difficulty even accessing files related to the government charges. Nine months passed before a lawyer could visit her. “He was not allowed to bring a single piece of paper, and he was allowed to speak with Nestora for only forty-five minutes,” Ávila said. “How can you defend somebody like that?” Ávila recruited Thomas Antkowiak, the director of the International Human Rights Clinic, at the Seattle University School of Law. “Her rights had been violated,” Antkowiak told me. “This persecution against social activists, against human-rights defenders, against indigenous leaders, is happening all over Mexico.” In late 2013, he filed a petition to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, seeking to establish that Salgado’s imprisonment was illegal; Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission declared that it had found violations of Salgado’s right to due process. In the meantime, Salgado’s fame began to grow. “Nestora became a symbol of social rage,” Abel Barrera, the director of Tlachinollan, said. “She had to expose the relationships between the authorities and organized crime, and, for the state authorities of Guerrero, she went too far. For the people who were defenseless against organized crime, she did what she had to do.”</p>\n<p>Salgado’s defenders portrayed her case as a matter of political persecution. “She touched on the interests of the governor and the mayor,” Amanda Rivero, one of her Mexican lawyers, said. “The only way to stop the community police was to arrest Nestora.” The state alleged that Salgado forced business owners to help pay for her group’s operations; she says that she held fund-raisers but never coerced anyone. Her colleagues on the force said that they had not asked for ransoms; instead, they collected retribution fines, which were paid to victims. One of the people Salgado allegedly kidnapped and tortured, a man named Francisco Flores Jiménez, told the Mexican press that his rights were respected during the reëducation process, and that his family was never asked for a ransom. He also claimed that the young women who accused Salgado of kidnapping were treated well, and were there with the consent of their parents; Salgado’s attorneys entered the signed permission slips into evidence. None of the victims named by the prosecution showed up in court.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>In March, 2016, after Salgado had been incarcerated for two years and eight months, a state court cleared her of all charges. Immediately, the attorney general of Guerrero issued three new warrants, with further counts of murder, kidnapping, robbery, and organized crime. Soon afterward, I met Salgado in an empty office at Penal de Tepepan, a women’s prison on the southern edge of Mexico City. Salgado had a cold, and she huddled into a brown leather couch in a neon-green sweatshirt and black leggings. She feared what the government would do to her, but she was optimistic: she felt that she would soon be home with her family, in Renton. “For sure, I will leave here soon,” she said.</p>\n<p>Salgado’s daughter Grisel calls her “strong-headed,” pointing out that, when her children expressed concern over her work, she replied that she would rather die fighting than live on her knees. But things had changed. She stayed in the clinic as much as she could; she was nervous about encountering other prisoners. Misinformation about her was so widespread that some inmates thought she was implicated in the disappearance of forty-three teacher trainees in Ayotzinapa—an incident that had occurred while she was imprisoned. Women had called her profane names in the corridors. “It’s dangerous for me to be in the general population, because people look at me like the enemy,” she said.</p>\n<p>In her cell were piles of books from supporters: a biography of the indigenous guerrilla Lucio Cabañas (“My idol”), a history of Catholic nuns, a book on the Zapatistas, Paulo Coelho’s “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0062315005/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511192026&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+alchemist\">The Alchemist</a>.” But she found it hard to concentrate on reading. “Your mind is always thinking about why they think you’re a criminal, why they put you inside,” she said. It all felt like a plot to drive her insane. She wrote in a journal, and tried to avoid the news.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0f38fd2c4e135599ca7214}}--></div><p>Three days later, she learned that the court had found her innocent: again, the victims named in the arrest orders hadn’t showed up. Salgado walked out of the prison in an olive-green polo shirt with the <em class=\"small\">CRAC</em>-P.C. logo and a matching baseball cap. Outside, amid a throng of supporters, community policemen from around Guerrero had assembled in two rows extending to the street. In bright sunshine, the men saluted. “They all recognized me as their commander,” she said. “It was beautiful.” One of them brought out handcuffs, which she put on and then dramatically pulled apart, as the crowd cheered. “I am free, thanks to the townspeople,” she told them. “Thank you for your struggle. Thank you for believing in me.”</p>\n</section><section><p>Salgado heard little news from Olinalá in prison, but she knew that the movement she had helped to revive was troubled. Across Mexico, vigilante militias, called <em>autodefensas,</em> had formed, and were operating outside the law. Some were opportunists, taking advantage of the chaos to carry out illegal activities; some had been infiltrated by the cartels, which used them to expand operational bases and to attack rivals. “Once the vigilante groups established control, they began to criminalize themselves,” Steven Dudley, a co-director of Insight Crime, which investigates organized crime in the Americas, said. “People started to realize many of them weren’t what they were saying they were.” As violence increased throughout the region, popular support waned. The government saw an opportunity for political advantage. It began working to disarm some of the <em>autodefensas</em>, while integrating others into a “rural defense corps” and hailing their work as an example of effective local justice.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Around Olinalá, some of the corrupt <em>autodefensas</em> falsely claimed to work with <em class=\"small\">CRAC</em>-P.C.—a dangerous situation, because the community police could be caught between the government and the cartels. “We’ve had threats in our own homes, phone calls, and we’ve heard comments on the streets,” Calixto Reyes, the community policeman, said. They patrolled only occasionally, and believed that the <em>sicarios</em> had moved back into town. “Some people are still trying to do something, but everyone is afraid now, and they don’t have any support from the government,” Anabel Hernández said. “It is not enough to fight them alone.”</p>\n<p>There were people in Olinalá who felt that Salgado had brought trouble to the town. “Just because no one follows the law doesn’t mean you can make up your own law,” Bernardo Rosendo, who runs the art school, said. He was friendly with both Salgado and Patrón Jiménez, the prosecutor she had arrested. “She should have taken Patrón Jiménez to the authorities with proof. He was being punished under a law we had never heard of. How can you have a state within a state?” For some, it rankled that Salgado was free while several of her colleagues were still imprisoned. Among them was Gonzalo Molina, a <em class=\"small\">CRAC</em>-P.C. leader in the town of Tixtla, who was arrested after he protested Salgado’s detention by leading his force to disarm the Tixtla municipal police. Like others, he blames Salgado for not doing more to negotiate his freedom.</p>\n<p>Not long after Salgado was released, I met her at her family’s apartment in Renton, a plain, comfortable place in a quiet neighborhood. The walls of the living room were filled with photos and illustrations of Salgado, sent by well-wishers; her children and grandchildren wandered in and out. Sitting on the couch, Salgado said that her intentions had been good: “We tried to bring peace to the town, to care for and protect everyone. We didn’t want to start a war.” (Rosendo put it another way: “No matter what happens, she has the conviction that she did what she had to do, and that it was the right thing to do.”) Salgado went on, “I did so many good things in my town. A lot of people liked me. The government accused me of so many things I didn’t do. Now they have accepted that I was within the law, but they took almost three years.”</p>\n<p>Eusebio González Rodríguez, the mayor of Olinalá, told me that, while he respected Salgado, he found the actions of the community police dubious. “I always told the government of Guerrero that if it was authorizing self-defense groups then it would have to control them. It’s a situation that spiralled out of the state government’s control,” he said. “I didn’t agree with the fact that there was no limit to the community police’s function.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The state still maintains that Salgado is a criminal; the Guerrero prosecutor has appealed her release. Álvarez, the state-security spokesman, said, “Even though she acted within Law 701, she went against the constitutional precepts that protect human rights.” Wary of the power that the law gives indigenous civilian forces, politicians have proposed that it be revised to regulate their work.</p>\n<p>Salgado argues that crime fell dramatically while the community police were working in Olinalá and the surrounding towns. “There was nowhere for criminals to hide,” she said. “Yes, they can be selling drugs, but not in plain sight, like they used to.” State authorities also believe that the town’s security improved; they say that reports of crime actually increased, but suggest that it was because people felt more comfortable alerting authorities. And recent events have lent credence to Salgado’s charges of government malfeasance. In October, 2014, Aguirre, the governor, resigned amid outrage over the disappearance of the teacher trainees in Ayotzinapa. In his last days in office, he claimed that many of the municipal police forces were working with the cartels; the federal government has since disbanded a third of Guerrero’s municipal police departments. Rogelio Ortega, the interim governor of Guerrero, who replaced Aguirre, called the imprisonment of community policemen “a case of political prisoners.”</p>\n<p>Salgado talks at times about going back to police work, although if she returns, she risks being detained by the government or killed by revenge-seekers. Ávila said he would support her. “We have many abandoned little towns in Guerrero, because people have been forced to leave,” he said. “We need to keep fighting.” He considered for a moment. “Of course, the day she decides to go back to Olinalá I’m going to worry a lot.”</p>\n<p>In her living room, Salgado told me that she still fervently believed in the need for community police. “It’s the only choice people have in Guerrero,” she said. “They know that we can be in charge of our own security.” She shrugged. The cracks in her assurance were starting to show. “If they don’t want to do it, that’s on them,” she said. “But it’s the only option that we have.” ♦</p>\n</section></div></div>"}}]},{"name":"In This Week’s Issue","items":[{"layout":"thumbnail_article","magazineStartPage":5,"article":{"id":"5a0c610f2d7392721cdd59d8","type":"article","name":"magazine/2017/11/27/celebrating-david-hockneys-eightieth-birthday","origin":"In This Week’s Issue","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/celebrating-david-hockneys-eightieth-birthday","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-17T09:00:00.000Z","issue_name":"November 27, 2017 Issue"},"toutImage":{"id":"5a0dec042ec1303c9b4aca35","description":"Courtesy the Metropolitan Museum of Art","title":"171127_r30970","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0dec042ec1303c9b4aca35/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_r30970.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0dec042ec1303c9b4aca35/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_r30970.jpg"},"featured@2x":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0dec042ec1303c9b4aca35/4:3/w_1000,c_limit/171127_r30970.jpg"}}},"ledeImage":{"id":"5a0dec042ec1303c9b4aca35","description":"Courtesy the Metropolitan Museum of Art","title":"171127_r30970","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0dec042ec1303c9b4aca35/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_r30970.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0dec042ec1303c9b4aca35/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_r30970.jpg"}}},"blocks":[],"title":"Celebrating David Hockney’s Eightieth Birthday","dek":"The Met holds a retrospective for the British painter, whose work uses landscape and autobiography as entwined motifs.","description":"The Met holds a retrospective for the British painter, whose work uses landscape and autobiography as entwined motifs.","rubric":"Art","content":"<div class=\"article\"><div class=\"article-body\"><p>The British painter <strong>David Hockney</strong> turned eighty this year.

If everyone cranked the same song at the same time, we could tear the roof off this sucker, or at least blow out the bricks and glass, and a giant all-seeing audiophile could peer in and assess the city’s speaker stacks. He (and this giant sound snob would have to be a man, in pull-on boots) would perhaps linger longest over the steampunk components and curiosities to be found in a spacious loft on the top floor of an industrial building in Dumbo—the showroom of Oswalds Mill Audio, and the lair of its principal and founder, Jonathan Weiss.</p>\n<p>O.M.A. designs and manufactures meticulous, beautiful, and very expensive machines for the reproduction of recorded music. The company’s headquarters are in Lehigh County, in Pennsylvania, in an old mill Weiss renovated for this purpose twenty years ago. Weiss, who is fifty-three, believes that most of us listen wrong; we settle for horribly compressed recordings on crappy components. “If you don’t know what good sound is, trying to describe it is like explaining the taste of salt,” he said recently.</p>\n<p>For his amplifiers, Weiss uses vintage vacuum tubes originally meant for ballistic missiles or Second World War radios, and he favors so-called horn speakers made of wood. His top-of-the-line loudspeaker system, at three hundred and forty thousand dollars (no wonder we settle), is the Imperia: two seven-foot steel towers, each with a couple of huge flared wooden horns, one atop another, along with some smaller aluminum-alloy horns. Between them, on the floor, are the boxed bass horns. The standing horns, fashioned out of Pennsylvania ash, bring to mind an old gramophone, or a morning glory. They make it sound as if the musicians are in the room.</p>\n<p>On a recent evening, a few dozen guests came to Dumbo for what Weiss calls a sound tasting—in this case, to hear a new album by the country singer Lee Ann Womack, who was in town from Nashville. Womack, in gold stilettos and a black dress, and her husband and producer, Frank Liddell, in jeans and a navy long-sleeved T-shirt, milled around Weiss’s big, rustic kitchen, drinking wine, as the Imperia, at the other end of the loft, resurrected Patsy Cline and John Coltrane.</p>\n<p>“I grew up in East Texas, and I had my idea of the kinds of music I wanted to make,” Womack said. “And then I signed a record deal in Nashville, where they have a certain way they market things and a way they want the music to sound.” She was on the hook for eight commercial country albums, which took sixteen years to complete. “The entire time I was doing that, I would go to events with my friends, who are, like, Buddy Miller, Jim Lauderdale, Patty Griffin, and they were the cool kids, you know? I was, like, ‘The cool kids are over there. I can’t wait till I can go join the cool kids.’ And so now I can. I’m able to do what I want to do, what I really love.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Womack and Liddell recorded the new album, “The Lonely, the Lonesome &amp; the Gone,” in a very non-Nashvegas way—old microphones, live takes, traditional instruments—at SugarHill Studios, in Houston, a venerable cinder-block hutch where Lightnin’ Hopkins, George Jones, and Willie Nelson, among many others, got their wings.</p>\n<p>Liddell said, “If you’re in a studio in Nashville, and there are three studios, you’re always, like, ‘Wonder what they’re doing in there—probably something shitty.’ It’s all this competition, whereas in Houston you’re making music.” Liddell is from Houston. He and Womack stayed at his mother’s house. “We went there to get away, get off the beaten path. The things that came out of it were not the things that we necessarily sought going in. East Texas is a strange place. No one wants anything to do with it. But all the greats—you know, George Jones, Ray Price, Lefty Frizzell, Johnny Horton—great singers came from there. Guys that were poor and stuck and broke, it brought that blues element. Could be the pine trees. Sometimes you don’t see the light of day. Anyway, we were looking for a place where we could just get dirty, which is what we did.”</p>\n<p>The hope was that Weiss’s Imperia horns would do justice to the dirt. The guests fanned out around the towers, and Weiss snuck in behind them to fiddle with some dials and place stylus on vinyl. Kick drum, E string, pedal steel, an intake of breath: the players were as present in the room as Weiss himself, as he nervously checked on his components. Ten songs in, there was Womack’s stark take on “Long Black Veil.” Womack, who’d been hanging back, stepped up close to one of the Imperia stacks and leaned against a steel beam, a quizzical look on her face. The pines? ♦</p>\n</section></div></div>"}},{"layout":"thumbnail_article","magazineStartPage":56,"article":{"id":"5a0c61ec2d7392721cdd59da","type":"article","name":"magazine/2017/11/27/the-lost-troop","origin":"In This Week’s Issue","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/the-lost-troop","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-20T10:01:00.000Z","issue_name":"November 27, 2017 Issue"},"toutImage":{"id":"5a0de74e930f34300422004e","description":"Photograph by Tim Hetherington / Magnum","title":"171127_r30982web","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0de74e930f34300422004e/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_r30982web.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0de74e930f34300422004e/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_r30982web.jpg"},"featured@2x":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0de74e930f34300422004e/4:3/w_1000,c_limit/171127_r30982web.jpg"}}},"ledeImage":{"id":"5a0de74e930f34300422004e","description":"Photograph by Tim Hetherington / Magnum","title":"171127_r30982web","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0de74e930f34300422004e/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_r30982web.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0de74e930f34300422004e/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_r30982web.jpg"}}},"blocks":[{"type":"cartoon","id":"/cartoons/5a0de74e32e52953cc4d2a9c","attributes":{"id":"5a0de74e32e52953cc4d2a9c","title":"a21451","caption":"“That’s just my agent—pay him no heed.”","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a0de74e32e52953cc4d2a9c/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_a21451.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a0de74e32e52953cc4d2a9c/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_a21451.jpg"}}}},{"type":"cartoon","id":"/cartoons/5a0de74e2c4e135599ca7103","attributes":{"id":"5a0de74e2c4e135599ca7103","title":"a21413","caption":"“I finally got myself organized and unsubscribed from all those e-mails.”","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a0de74e2c4e135599ca7103/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_a21413.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a0de74e2c4e135599ca7103/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_a21413.jpg"}}}}],"title":"The Lost Troop","dek":"","description":"“We could have left it all behind, walked off the outpost into the desert, never to be seen again.”","rubric":"Fiction","author":[{"id":"5910a7126c4c222f03a82dc9","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":" ","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/will-mackin","email":"","name":"Will Mackin","socialMedia":[],"title":"Will Mackin retired from the Navy in 2014.

It was December and the weather was dog shit, so a degree of slowness was expected. But this went beyond slowness. It was like peace had broken out and nobody’d told us. Nights we’d meet in the ops hut for the mission brief. We’d tune the flat screens to the drones—over Ghazni, Orgun, and Khost—only to find all three orbiting within the same cloud. We’d listen to static on the UHF. We’d stare at phones that never rang. We could have left it all behind, walked off the outpost into the desert, never to be seen again. We could have created the Legend of the Lost Troop. Instead, we chose some place where we imagined the enemy might be hiding—a compound on the banks of the Helmand River, a brake shop in downtown Marjah, a cave high in the Hindu Kush mountains—and we ventured out there, hoping for a fight.</p>\n<p>I thought of the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima, who, when their island fell to the Americans, didn’t know that it had fallen. Who, not long after, didn’t hear that A-bombs had destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that their emperor had admitted defeat. Those soldiers hid in tunnels, on Iwo, for weeks after the war was over. For months, even. For them, the fight continued in those dark and narrow spaces, until they ran out of food. Until they drank the last of their water. Until, absent the means and/or the will to take their own lives, they climbed out of ratholes into the sun, to wander warm fields of lava rock in surrender.</p>\n<p>I wondered if, one night, we’d drop out of the starry sky in our blacked-out helicopters and land near a walled compound in the desert. We’d run toward that compound with the rotor wash at our backs, through the dust cloud that had been kicked up by our arrival and out the other side. Through a crooked archway in the compound’s outer wall, we’d enter the courtyard. And there, among the fig trees and goats, we’d find an American tourist with a camera slung around his neck. Having served his time in Afghanistan, our fellow-American had gone home, fallen in love, got married, and had the two bow-haired daughters now hiding behind his legs. Maybe he’d wanted his girls to see how brightly the stars shone in the desert. Maybe he’d wanted to share with them all the strange places the Army had sent him, way back when. I imagined that he’d look over at us and then say, with understanding and remorse, “Dudes, war’s over.”</p>\n<p>But, as far as we knew, it wasn’t. Therefore, we met in the ops hut every night at eight. In the absence of new intelligence, we’d review old intelligence. We’d double-check dead ends and reëxamine cold cases. Finding nothing mission-worthy, Hal, our troop chief, would open the floor to suggestions. It’d be quiet for a while, as everyone thought.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>“Come on,” Hal would say.</p>\n<p>He’d be standing in the middle of the room. We’d be sitting on plywood tables, balancing on busted swivel chairs, leaning against the thin walls. The drones, orbiting inside moonlit cumulonimbi, would beam their emerald visions back to us. Lightning would strike twenty miles away and the UHF would crackle. I, for one, didn’t have any good ideas to offer.</p>\n<p>One night, Digger spoke up: “Who remembers that graveyard decorated like a used-car lot, out in Khost?”</p>\n<p>I raised my hand, along with a few others.</p>\n<p>“I think we might need to go back there,” Digger said.</p>\n<p>The graveyard in question was on the northern rim of a dusty crater. We’d patrolled just to the south of it, a few weeks prior, on an easterly course. The “used-car lot” decorations were plastic strands of multicolored pennants. One end of each strand was tied high in an ash tree that stood at the center of the graveyard. The other ends were staked into the hard ground outside the circle of graves. The graves themselves were piles of stone, shaped like overturned rowboats. I couldn’t recall the name of our mission that night, its task and purpose, its outcome. But that graveyard stuck with me. I remembered the pennants snapping in the wind, dust parting around the graves like a current.</p>\n<p>Digger, who’d been closer to the graveyard than I was, thought that the graves had looked suspicious. He thought they resembled old cellar doors—the type, I imagined, you’d find outside a farmhouse in Nebraska and run to from darkened fields as a tornado was bearing down. Digger postulated that at least one of those graves was made of fake stones.</p>\n<p>“Styrofoam balls,” he suggested to us in the ops hut, “painted to look like stones, then glued to a plywood sheet.” Digger thought that, if we sneaked into that graveyard and pulled open that hypothetical door, we might discover a Taliban nerve center, a bomb factory, or an armory. Digger had no idea what could be down there, but he’d got a weird feeling walking past that graveyard that night.</p>\n<p>“Good enough for me,” Hal said. “Let’s make it happen.”</p>\n<p>We rode our helicopters—two dual-rotor, minigun-equipped MH-47s—northeast from Logar. We sat in mesh jump seats, across from one another, roughly ten per side. The MH-47, at altitude, stabilized like a swaying hammock. Lube, dripping from the crankcase, smelled like bong water. Beyond the open ramp at the back end of the tubular cargo bay, we watched the night pass by like the scenery in an old movie.</p>\n<p>The 47s dropped us off in a dry riverbed, three miles east of the graveyard. We patrolled westward under heavy clouds. The clouds carried a powerful static charge, while the earth remained neutral. Sparkling dust hovered, and through night vision I saw my brothers, walking with me, as concentrations of this dust. All I heard, as we walked, was my own breathing.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>We connected with the crater’s easternmost point, then walked in a counterclockwise direction along its rim until we reached the graveyard. We found the pennants torn and tattered, the ash tree diseased, the graves crooked. None of the stones were made of Styrofoam. Not one of the graves was an elaborately disguised entrance to a nefarious subterranean lair. Though, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the dust that I’d remembered parting around the graves, like a current, actually funnelled into the spaces between the stones. In fact, it seemed to be getting sucked into those spaces, as though there were some sort of void below the graves, which lent a measure of credence to Digger’s theory.</p>\n<p>From the top of one grave, I selected a smooth, round stone, about the size of a shot-put ball, and I heaved it into the crater.</p>\n<p>Joe, our interpreter, was right there to scold me. “I would expect such disrespectful behavior from the Taliban,” he said, “but not from you.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0de74e32e52953cc4d2a9c}}--></div><p>Joe was Afghani. His real name was Jamaluddein. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in 1980, he’d escaped to the U.K. with his parents; he was twelve years old at the time. Now, as a middle-aged man, he’d returned to help save his country from ruin. He wore armor on missions, but he carried no weapons. His interpretations of our enemy’s muttered words were always clear and precise. He had a bad habit of walking two steps behind me on patrol and closing that distance whenever we made contact with the enemy. Thus, I’d seen conflagrations reflected in the smudged lenses of Joe’s glasses. I’d heard him whisper prayers between sporadic detonations. His voice, with its derived British accent and perpetual tone of disappointment, exactly matched that of my beleaguered conscience.</p>\n<p>So I jumped into the crater after the stone. I found it at the end of a long, concave groove in the dust. Turning toward the crater’s rim, I saw my boot prints in the dust, descending the slope, each as perfect as Neil Armstrong’s first step on the moon. On my way back up to the graveyard, I was careful not to disturb those tracks, or the flawless groove that had been carved by the stone. I wanted these things to remain, I suppose, in the event that an asteroid should slam into the planet, sloughing away the atmosphere, boiling the seas, and instantly ending life on earth. Our troop—asphyxiated, desiccated, frozen—would lie scattered about the graveyard, preserved in the seamless void of space forever, or at least until other intelligent beings came along and discovered us. Perhaps because those beings existed as thin bars of blue light, incapable of offensive or defensive action, they’d puzzle over our armor, our rifles, our grenades. They’d wonder, especially, why we’d worn such things to a graveyard. There would be no mystery, however, regarding the boot prints in the crater, since they’d know, from the boots still on my feet, that I was the one who’d left them. Furthermore, they’d deduce, from the groove, that I’d descended into the crater after a stone. Only one particular stone could’ve cut that groove. And they might find it, among a thousand others, right where I’d returned it, atop the grave, just moments before the asteroid struck the earth. But none of that would explain why the stone had been in the crater in the first place. “Did one of them throw it?” the curious bars of blue light might ask themselves.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>The next night, in the ops hut, we still had nothing, intelligence-wise. Hal asked for suggestions again. Another hush fell on the troop as we sat thinking. Hal stood in the middle of the room. On the one hand, he loved the war. On the other, he loved us. Green clouds floated by on the flat screens. Fuzzy static emanated from the UHF. Archie, who, a month prior, had replaced Yaz, whom we’d lost in a soybean field in Kunduz, stood up from the floor. He pulled a tin of breath mints from his shirt pocket.</p>\n<p>“I probably should’ve told you guys about this sooner,” he said.</p>\n<p>The tin, Archie explained, had arrived in the mail about two weeks ago. It was sent by Yaz’s widow, Connie.</p>\n<p>I knew Connie from troop barbecues, Halloween parties, and the like. I remembered her, once, dressed as a cowgirl, dancing in Digger’s kitchen. She’d fired cap guns at the ceiling, which made the fluorescent light hazy. Yaz, standing by the bean dip, had watched his wife holster her toy pistols. He’d smiled as she spun an invisible lasso over her head. Roping Yaz, Connie had pulled him in, hand over hand, while he feigned resistance. His breath must have smelled like corn chips. Hers, I imagined, smelled just fine.</p>\n<p>The tin that Archie showed us in the ops hut contained a handful of Yaz’s ashes.</p>\n<p>“Connie asked me to find a good place to spread these around,” he said. “And I tried, but no place seems good enough. You guys got any ideas?”</p>\n<p>Digger suggested that we climb to the top of Mt. Noshaq, the tallest peak in Afghanistan, and release Yaz’s ashes into a spindrift. Tull proposed a verdant meadow, north of J-bad, where he and Yaz once went <em class=\"small\">AWOL</em> to hunt elk. I made an argument for the tiny garden of purple flowers that had grown behind Yaz’s tent, where he used to spit out his toothpaste. Hal, however, wanted to return to Kunduz.</p>\n<p>Kunduz was four hundred kilometres north of Logar. The 47s flew higher than usual to get there. Frost formed on the windows. The engines whined, the rotors slipped, and the helicopter wobbled as if we were balancing at the end of a very long pole. I almost hoped that something would go wrong. Nothing catastrophic, of course. Just a low-oil light or the engine temperature creeping into the red. Something that would force us to land short and reconsider. I didn’t want to see that field in Kunduz again, with its dark puddles reflecting the stars, its soybean shoots glowing white. I didn’t want to smell its fertilized tang. But nothing went wrong. We touched down on the western edge of the field, right where we’d touched down before, opposite the ditch that had given me so much trouble.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>We’d first landed in that field on a clear night in late September. Jupiter had been the focal point of a crescent moon. The ditch where we knew the enemy was hiding was east of our position and outside small-arms range. I thought, at the time, that there were no more than half a dozen Taliban in that ditch. I’d based that estimate, partly, on how the shrubbery had quaked when they scurried around behind it. I’d considered, as well, the frequency of AK fire, which, from that safe distance, sounded like movie projectors running out of film. For six Taliban wallowing in a ditch, I figured that a pair of thousand-pound bombs, with delayed fuses, ought to do the trick.</p>\n<p>A combination of ash and sissoo grew in that ditch. The aforementioned shrubbery tangled the spaces between the trees. I brought two jets in from the north, in trail formation. The first bomb ignited every tree and shrub. The second launched burning trees like moon shots. I turned to my right, expecting to find Hal. Instead, I found Joe—hands in pockets, armored belly protruding. The burning trench was reflected in his dirty glasses.</p>\n<p>Hal appeared from behind me. “You done?” he asked.</p>\n<p>What remained of the shrubbery was still, and the AKs had fallen silent.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>\n<p>We spread ourselves the length of the field for mop-up, then walked toward the ditch. Stars jiggled in the puddles. The mud smelled like turpentine. The soybean shoots resembled those albino creatures which live in the Atlantic’s deepest trench. Hal walked next to me. Yaz walked five men past Hal. The machine gun that Yaz carried weighed as much as the front axle of a Sentra. Its rounds were the size of soup cans. As we stepped into small-arms range, Tull whistled like a bird, in warning. Seconds later, a Taliban popped out of the ditch. The barrel of his AK, it seemed, was bent. The majority of his volley curved skyward.</p>\n<p>After Yaz fell, more Taliban came out of the ditch. Dozens, in fact. We turned them around quickly, then we fell back, dragging Yaz. Joe was right behind me, breathing hard. Hal called for <em class=\"small\">CASEVAC</em>, even though Yaz was already dead. Maybe he didn’t want us to think that he wouldn’t have done the same thing for us. Maybe he wanted us to believe that, as far as he was concerned, none of us would ever be dead. Or maybe he just wanted us to fight and not worry about it.</p>\n<p>I called out to every jet in the sky. The first wave arrived just as the <em class=\"small\">CASEVAC</em> was lifting off with Yaz. I brought the jets down in a clockwise spiral. I had them toss everything they had—five-hundred-, thousand-, two-thousand-pounders—into the ditch. A second wave of jets joined the first, then a third, and a fourth. I bombed the ditch until the mud puddles in the soybean field steamed, until the soybean shoots themselves melted, until it seemed as though I were standing in the ditch and bombing the field.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The soybean field looked no different in December. The ditch was unchanged, too, although the trees and the shrubbery were gone. I stood in the same place that I’d stood while controlling the jets, back in September. The rest of the troop walked into the field behind Archie. They formed a circle around him at the spot where Yaz was killed. Archie took a knee and pulled the tin from his pocket. He opened the lid, and tapped the side of the tin with his finger. I didn’t want to see the ashes fall, so I turned around, and there was Joe.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t your fault,” he said.</p>\n</section><section><p>Time passed mysteriously in the clouds. Unlike when the drones could see the ground, and a haystack or a cow would spin around the flat screen like the second hand of a clock, we had no idea how long we sat watching the spinning clouds. Meanwhile, the UHF clicked like something radioactive. This was the night after Kunduz, or the night after our return to Kunduz. We still had no intelligence. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, I tried peace on for size. I felt proud that I’d fought, but also glad that the war was over. Hal asked for suggestions, and Joe raised his hand.</p>\n<p>Hal said, “You don’t need to raise your hand.”</p>\n<p>“I had a teacher, in primary school, who used to hit my knuckles with a ruler,” Joe said. “I would like to pay him a visit.”</p>\n<p>“I had a teacher like that,” Hal said.</p>\n<p>“Me, too,” Digger said. The rest of us nodded, remembering.</p>\n<p>Joe had last seen his teacher at his old school, in the town of Ghawas, in Wardak Province, in 1979. Joe had been eleven at the time. The teacher had seemed ancient to Joe back then. In hindsight, however, Joe figured that his teacher had been no older than thirty. Which meant that there was a good chance, in 2008, that the teacher was still alive. He’d lived in a cabin near a forest, Joe remembered, though he couldn’t say exactly where. Joe assured us, though, that he could find the cabin if we could find his old school.</p>\n<p>We’d never had reason to patrol through Ghawas, therefore we had no maps of tactical value. Digger, who always planned our routes, turned to the computer that contained the satellite imagery. Our imagery of Ghawas was both stale and irregular. Half of it dated from the winter of 2003, the other half from the spring of 2005. The school, Joe said, was a stone building on the eastern bank of a river. It was situated just north of a bend in the river that was shaped like a question mark.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Hal, Joe, and I stood behind Digger as he searched Ghawas for a river with a question mark. He found it in an image that had been captured by a satellite on a May afternoon in 2005. Digger zoomed in, and we saw the river’s banks overflowing with snowmelt. Sunlight sparkled in the eddies. Reeds grew from stagnant pools. Digger scrolled northbound in search of the school. The imagery changed to winter. The river turned as dark as slate. A hundred yards north of the question mark, on the river’s eastern bank, we discovered a stone foundation poking through the ice. Joe thought it was too small to be the ruins of his old school, but then he realized that it had to be.</p>\n<p>From the school’s foundation, Joe guided Digger along the path that the teacher had walked on his way home. It ran north along the river for a snowy mile, then the imagery switched back to spring, and the path cut east into a warm field of grass. Joe, the student, used to follow the teacher, at a safe distance, across this field. Crouching in the tall grass, he would fantasize about leaping out and knocking his teacher down. More than revenge, though, he’d wanted to study his teacher. He kept his eyes on his desk in class all day, hoping to stay out of trouble. The walk home was his chance to actually see the man. Joe described him as tall and prematurely gaunt. He said that the teacher had worn a dark robe for the walk home in winter. In spring, he remembered butterflies rising in the teacher’s wake when he crossed the field.</p>\n<p>“Keep going,” Joe said to Digger.</p>\n<p>Digger continued scrolling across the sunlit field to a snow-covered forest. The image of the forest had been captured on a January evening in 2003. Shadows cast by the tall bare trees looked like the minute hands of a clock, all showing ten past the hour. Halfway through the forest, the satellite imagery ran out. The computer screen turned black.</p>\n<p>“He lives on the other side of that forest,” Joe said.</p>\n<p>“How far?” Hal asked.</p>\n<p>Joe touched a spot on the dark computer screen. “Here.”</p>\n<p>The four of us looked at that spot.</p>\n<p>“I’m thinking callout,” Digger said to Hal.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0de74e2c4e135599ca7103}}--></div><p>Callouts were best in unknown situations. Like, we didn’t know whether or not the cabin existed or how big it might be. We didn’t know who, other than the teacher, might be hiding inside, or how prepared he or they might be to mount a defense. To mitigate the risks posed by these unknowns, a callout would proceed in stages. The 47s would drop us off outside the cabin, beyond small-arms range. If there was fire from the cabin, we’d keep our distance, and I’d call in an air strike. If not, we’d run toward the cabin and flank it on two sides. Digger would throw a flash-bang through a windowpane. Light would tear through the cabin. Bangs would echo in the night. Once all was dark and quiet again, Joe would read a statement into a bullhorn, informing the startled occupants that we were coalition forces, there to protect the rights of the Afghan people.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>“Yeah,” Hal said. “Let’s go with a callout. But no flash-bang. And, Joe, I want you to say something different tonight.”</p>\n<p>Hal chose a line from the end of a song by Pink Floyd called “Another Brick in the Wall, Part Two.” The song opens with the lyric “We don’t need no education,” and goes on to denounce teachers as repressive and cynical. The song ends in a riot. As the students tear down their school, a teacher’s voice can be heard above the din, shouting lessons such as “Wrong! Do it again!” and “Stand still, laddie!” Hal chose one such lesson for Joe to shout through the bullhorn. Joe practiced it on the helicopter ride to Ghawas.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t eat your meat, you can’t have any pudding.”</p>\n<p>“No,” Hal interrupted. “You need more fear in your voice.”</p>\n<p>Joe and Digger sat on one side of the helicopter, Hal and I on the other. Night parted around us and mended in our wake.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think ‘fear’ is the right word,” I said.</p>\n<p>“It’s Joe’s teacher,” Digger said. “Let him say it however he wants.”</p>\n<p>“The teacher in the song is staring down an angry mob,” Hal said. “He can’t just say the words.”</p>\n<p>“I think my teacher is more crazy than afraid,” Joe said.</p>\n<p>“All right,” Hal said. “Let’s hear it again.”</p>\n<p>The windows in the MH-47 were made of Plexiglas. They were shaped like salad bowls. When you looked through them, things on the outside appeared either close and blurry or far away and blurry. There was a sweet spot in the lens, however, where something would appear perfectly magnified. Thus, as we banked over the highway that ran between Kandahar and Kabul, I saw a bleary-eyed trucker behind the wheel. As we floated over the mountains into Wardak, I saw a waterfall cascading into a crystalline lake. And when we turned above the ruins of Joe’s old school I imagined the building as it once was—stone walls, slate roof, and leaded-glass windows.</p>\n<p>We sped over the field of tall grass and over the woods at treetop level. The rotors beat louder as we pulled into a hover. We touched down on either side of the teacher’s cabin without taking fire. The 47s lifted off behind us and rotor wash shoved us through clumps of dry grass and over warm boulders. Archie, carrying Yaz’s massive gun, ran ahead of me, while Joe, with his red bullhorn, ran behind. The teacher’s cabin was the size of a one-car garage. A curl of smoke rose from its stone chimney. A neatly stacked woodpile stood behind it. Empty rabbit traps leaned against a wall. We formed lines on either side of the cabin. Taking my position, I saw myself reflected in a dark-blue window.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>We stood, still and quiet, outside the teacher’s cabin, as the 47s descended into a valley. Soon enough, their noise became a memory, then that memory faded. A cold wind rustled the grass. Our breath rose in thick clouds. I imagined the teacher lying awake in bed, wondering if he’d only dreamed of helicopters landing outside.</p>\n<p>Hal nodded at Joe, and Joe raised the bullhorn.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t eat your meat, you can’t have any pudding! <em>How</em> can you have any pudding if you don’t eat your meat!”</p>\n<p>Joe’s message echoed. A match flared inside the cabin, turning the windows orange. The teacher emerged in a nightcap, carrying a lit candle on a brass candlestick. He squinted at us standing in the darkness.</p>\n<p>Digger slapped away the candle. Hal stepped on the flame. I zip-tied the old man’s wrists, and Joe forced him to kneel on the hard ground.</p>\n<p>“What have I done?” he asked, like all the others.</p>\n<p>We didn’t answer. Instead, we left him, knees bleeding, to think about it, while we pushed into his cabin to see how he lived. ♦</p>\n</section></div></div>"}}]},{"name":"Popular","items":[{"layout":"thumbnail_article","magazineStartPage":34,"article":{"id":"59b179bda1e7d346d30ee2aa","type":"article","name":"magazine/2017/09/18/the-risk-of-nuclear-war-with-north-korea","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/18/the-risk-of-nuclear-war-with-north-korea","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-09-08T01:00:00.000Z","issue_name":"September 18, 2017 Issue"},"toutImage":{"id":"59b17aa93bdfa71b1433bdbf","description":"Photograph by Max Pinckers for The New Yorker","title":"170918_r30526_rd","caption":"A military officer at the D.M.Z.

The Madman Theory</h2>\n</section><section><p>The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, so there is no embassy in Washington, but for years the two countries have relied on the “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/08/11/inside-the-new-york-channel-between-the-united-states-and-north-korea/?utm_term=.2dd8b3e3a570\">New York channel</a>,” an office inside North Korea’s mission to the United Nations, to handle the unavoidable parts of our nonexistent relationship. The office has, among other things, negotiated the release of prisoners and held informal talks about nuclear tensions. In April, I contacted the New York channel and requested permission to visit Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>\n<p>The New York channel consists mostly of two genial middle-aged men: Pak Song Il, a husky diplomat with a gray brush cut; and his aide-de-camp, Kwon Jong Gun, who is younger and thinner. They go everywhere together. (The North Korean government has diplomats work in pairs, to prevent them from defecting, or being recruited as spies.) Under U.S. law, they can travel only twenty-five miles from Columbus Circle. Pak and Kwon met me near their office, for lunch at the Palm Too. They cautioned me that it might take several months to arrange a trip. North Korea periodically admits large groups of American journalists, to witness parades and special occasions, but it is more hesitant when it comes to individual reporters, who require close monitoring and want to talk about the nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Americans are accustomed to eruptions of hostility with North Korea, but in the past six months the enmity has reached a level rarely seen since the end of the Korean War, in 1953. The crisis has been hastened by fundamental changes in the leadership on both sides. In the six years since Kim Jong Un assumed power, at the age of twenty-seven, he has tested eighty-four missiles—more than double the number that his father and grandfather tested. Just before Donald Trump took office, in January, he expressed a willingness to wage a “preventive” <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-would-war-with-north-korea-look-like\">war</a> in North Korea, a prospect that previous Presidents dismissed because it would risk an enormous loss of life. Trump has said that in his one meeting with Barack Obama, during the transition, Obama predicted that North Korea, more than any other foreign-policy challenge, would test Trump. In private, Trump has told aides, “I will be judged by how I handle this.”</p>\n<p>On the Fourth of July, North Korea passed a major threshold: it launched its first <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-icbm.html\">intercontinental ballistic missile powerful enough to reach the mainland United States</a>. In response, on July 21st, authorities in Hawaii announced that they would revive <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/07/21/hawaii-rolling-out-civil-defense-plan-for-north-korean-missile-attack/?utm_term=.3f0ce2c2cd99\">a network of Cold War-era sirens</a>, to alert the public in the event of a nuclear strike. Trump said that he hopes to boost spending on missile defense by “many billions of dollars.” On September 3rd, after North Korea tested a nuclear weapon far larger than any it had revealed before—seven times the size of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki—the U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, warned that a threat to America or its allies would trigger a “<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/trump-north-korea-nuclear-242289\">massive military response</a>.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>A few days after the July 4th missile test, Pak told me that I could book a flight to Pyongyang. I submitted a list of people I wanted to interview, including diplomats and Kim Jong Un himself. About the latter, Pak only laughed. (Kim has never given an interview.) After Pak stopped laughing, he said I could talk to other officials. I wanted to understand how North Koreans think about the kind of violence that their country so often threatens. Were the threats serious, or mere posturing? How did they imagine that a war would unfold? Before my arrival in North Korea, I spent time in Washington, Seoul, and Beijing; many people in those places, it turned out, are asking the same things about the United States.</p>\n<p>About a week before my flight to Pyongyang, America’s dealings with North Korea deteriorated further. On August 5th, as punishment for the missile test, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/05/world/asia/north-korea-sanctions-united-nations.html\">U.N. Security Council adopted some of the strongest sanctions against any country in decades</a>, blocking the sale of coal, iron, and other commodities, which represent a third of North Korea’s exports. President Trump, in impromptu remarks at his golf club in New Jersey, said that “any more threats to the United States” will be met “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/operation-clean-up-trumps-mess-north-korea\">with fire and fury like the world has never seen</a>.” A few hours later, North Korea threatened to fire four missiles into the Pacific Ocean near the American territory of Guam, from which warplanes depart for flights over the Korean Peninsula. Trump replied, in a tweet, that “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/895970429734711298\">military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely</a>.”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the prospect of a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the most hermetic power on the globe had entered a realm of psychological calculation reminiscent of the Cold War, and the two men making the existential strategic decisions were not John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev but a senescent real-estate mogul and reality-television star and a young third-generation dictator who has never met another head of state.

Each will move ever closer to the edge, so that the other begins to fear that he might slip and take both of them down. It is a matter of creating the right amount of fear without losing control. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Arms-Influence-Thomas-C-Schelling/dp/0837189802\">Schelling wrote</a>, “However rational the adversaries, they may compete to appear the more irrational, impetuous, and stubborn.” But what if the adversaries <em>are</em> irrational, impetuous, and stubborn?</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>Three days after Trump’s “locked and loaded” tweet, I flew from Beijing to Pyongyang. The flight was mostly empty, except for some Chinese businessmen and Iranian diplomats. I was accompanied by the photographer Max Pinckers and his assistant, Victoria Gonzalez-Figueras. In the air, I deleted from my laptop some books about North Korea; the government is especially sensitive about portrayals of the Kim family. (When you buy a North Korean newspaper with an image of Kim Jong Un on the front page, the clerk folds it carefully, to avoid creasing his face.) The airport was quiet and immaculate. At customs, when I opened my suitcase, I saw that I had forgotten to discard two books: “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GREAT-SUCCESSOR-JONG-POLITICAL-CARTOON-ebook/dp/B00MWP8NYQ\">The Great Successor</a>,” an account of Kim’s ascent, and “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Impossible-State-North-Korea-Future/dp/0061998516/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504820109&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Impossible+State\">The Impossible State</a>.” The customs officer called over a colleague, who flipped through the pages and alerted his superiors. I was led to a room, where an officer told me that the books are “very disparaging about the D.P.R.K.” He wanted to know where and when I had bought them, and whether I had read them. After some discussion, I was told to write a statement promising “never to bring them to the D.P.R.K. again.” I signed it, the books were confiscated, and I hustled on.</p>\n<p>I was approached by a smiling man in a crisp white short-sleeved button-down shirt with a small red pin on his left breast, bearing a likeness of Kim Il Sung—Kim Jong Un’s grandfather, and the first leader of North Korea. (Citizens over the age of sixteen are expected to wear a badge celebrating at least one of the Kims.) He introduced himself, in English, as Mr. Pak, of the Foreign Ministry’s Institute for American Studies, and said that he would be my guide. I followed him outside, where the air was clear and still. Pak presented the others who would be accompanying us: two drivers and a slim young man with a military bearing named Mr. Kim, who provided only one-word answers to my occasional queries. Pak and I climbed into a Toyota S.U.V.</p>\n<p>Pak—by coincidence, he has the same full name, Pak Song Il, as the senior member of the New York channel—is thirty-five years old, with short bushy hair and a placid demeanor. Most of North Korea’s twenty-five million people are not permitted to travel abroad, but Pak’s job has allowed him to visit several countries, which he described in terms of their cleanliness: Switzerland (very clean); Belgium (not so clean); Bangladesh (not clean at all). In 2015, he went to Utah (clean) for a nongovernmental exchange attended by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The experience convinced him that Mormons have a lot in common with North Koreans. “When the L.D.S. started, they were hated,” he told me. “They were sent to the desert. But they made it thrive. They are organized like a bee colony, where everyone works for one purpose and they would die for it. And they make huge output, as a result. We understand each other very well.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/59b1e270f9b5710db7cd91f0}}--></div><p>Pak spends most of his time analyzing American politics and news reports, trying to divine America’s intentions regarding North Korea. Since the election of Donald Trump, he said, the task had become more demanding. “When he speaks, I have to figure out what he means, and what his next move will be,” he said. “This is very difficult.”</p>\n<p>That would probably please Trump, who prides himself on being unpredictable. Many commentators have drawn comparisons to Richard Nixon and his “madman theory” of diplomacy, in which Nixon sought to leave his adversaries with the impression that he possessed an unstable, dangerous state of mind.</p>\n<p>Later, I asked Pak what he and other North Koreans thought of Trump.</p>\n<p>“He might be irrational—or too smart. We don’t know,” he said. They suspected that Trump’s comment about “fire and fury” might be part of a subtle strategy. “Like the Chinese ‘<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Sun-Tzu/dp/1599869772/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504820281&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Art+of+War\">Art of War</a>,’ ” he said. “If he’s not driving toward a point, then what is he doing? That is our big question.”</p>\n<p>For Pak and other analysts in North Korea, the more important question about the United States extends beyond Trump. “Is the American public ready for war?” he asked. “Does the Congress want a war? Does the American military want a war? Because, if they want a war, then we must prepare for that.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b17aac3bdfa71b1433bdc1}}--><!--{{/photos/59b17aad7ae17e19caf05fc3}}--></div></div><p>We arrived at the Kobangsan Guest House, a small, three-story hotel on the outskirts of Pyongyang, surrounded by corn and rice fields. The place had an air of low-cost opulence—chandeliers, rhinestones, and pleather sofas. We were the only guests. The Foreign Ministry uses the hotel for “Americans and V.I.P.s,” Pak said. (In 2013, Eric Schmidt, the former C.E.O. of Google, was put up there.) In North Korea, no visitor is left unattended, and Pak had a room down the hall from mine. I paid a hundred and forty-one dollars a night—a month’s income for the average citizen. “From time immemorial, there is a tradition of giving foreigners the best service,” Pak explained. “The No. 1 thing is to protect them, unless they are spies or enemies.”</p>\n<p>We had dinner that night with Ri Yong Pil, a Foreign Ministry official in his mid-fifties, who is the vice-president of the Institute for American Studies. Gregarious and confident, he served eight years in the Army, learned English, and became a diplomat. He raised a glass of Taedonggang beer and toasted our arrival. We were in a private hotel dining room that felt like a surgical theatre: a silent, scrubbed, white-walled room bathed in bright light. Two waitresses in black uniforms served each course: ginkgo soup, black-skin chicken, kimchi, river fish, and vanilla ice cream, along with glasses of beer, red wine, and soju. (The U.N. says that seventy-two per cent of North Koreans rely on government food rations, and the country is experiencing a historic drought. But in Pyongyang a foreign guest eats embarrassingly well.)</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Ri made a series of points, waiting for me to write each one in my notebook:</p>\n<p>“The United States is not the only country that can wage a preventive war.”</p>\n<p>“Three million people have volunteered to join the war if necessary.”</p>\n<p>“Historically, Korean people suffered because of weakness. That bitter lesson is kept in our hearts.”</p>\n<p>“Strengthening our defensive military capacity is the only way to keep the peace.”</p>\n<p>“We are small in terms of people and area, but in terms of dignity we are the most powerful in the world. We will die in order to protect that dignity and sovereignty.”</p>\n<p>After several more toasts, Ri loosened his tie and shed his jacket. He had some questions. “In your system, what is the power of the President to launch a war?” he asked. “Does the Congress have the power to decide?”</p>\n<p>A President can do a lot without Congress, I said. Ri asked about the nuclear codes: “I’ve heard the black bag is controlled by McMaster. Is it true?” (He was referring to H. R. McMaster, the national-security adviser.)</p>\n<p>No, the President can launch nukes largely on his own, I said. “What about in your country?”</p>\n<p>His answer was similar. “Our Supreme Leader has absolute power to launch a war,” he said.</p>\n<p>I turned in early. My room was furnished in the style of Versailles by way of Atlantic City—champagne-colored leather and gold-painted trim. The room was equipped with a TV, but, instead of North Korean programming, the only options were Asian satellite channels. There was no news to be found. I flipped past a Christian evangelist and a Singaporean cooking show, and drifted off to the sight of sumo wrestlers colliding.</p>\n</section><section><p>Trump is the fourth U.S. President who has vowed to put an end to North Korea’s nuclear program. Bill Clinton signed a deal in which North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear development in exchange for oil and a civilian reactor, but neither side fulfilled its commitments. George W. Bush refused bilateral negotiations, then switched tacks and convened what are known as the Six-Party Talks. Obama first offered inducements, and later adopted a stonewalling policy called “strategic patience.” Under Trump, the U.S. has led the U.N. Security Council in its passage of the eighth round of sanctions against North Korea in eleven years. The Kims’ nuclear program is still going. “They have managed to play an abysmally bad hand for more than seventy years,” Evans Revere, a former head of Korean affairs at the State Department, told me.</p>\n<p>U.S. intelligence has often underestimated the progress of North Korea’s weapons development. But now the basic facts, accumulated by American, European, and Chinese intelligence agencies, are clear. North Korea has between twenty and sixty usable nuclear warheads, and ICBMs capable of hitting targets as far away, perhaps, as Chicago. It has yet to marry those two programs in a single weapon, but American intelligence agencies estimate that it will achieve that within a year. The U.S. is in the process of upgrading its ability to shoot down an incoming missile. It reportedly tried to derail North Korea’s weapons development through cyber sabotage, but it only delayed the progress. A former U.S. official said, “You spend millions putting it in place and then you ask, ‘Did it work?’ And the answer comes back: Maybe.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>In recent talks, when Americans have asked whether any combination of economic and diplomatic benefits, or security guarantees, could induce Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons, the answer has been no. North Koreans invariably mention the former Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi. In 2003, when Qaddafi agreed to surrender his nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, Bush promised others who might do the same that they would have an “open path to better relations with the United States.” Eight years later, the U.S. and <em class=\"small\">NATO</em> helped to overthrow Qaddafi, who was captured, humiliated, and killed by rebels. At the time, North Korea said that Qaddafi’s fall was “a grave lesson” that persuading other nations to give up weapons was “an invasion tactic.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b17aaff9b5710db7cd8d6c}}--><!--{{/photos/59b17ab0c56d770f345890ff}}--></div></div><p>James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, who visited Pyongyang in 2014, told me, “The North Koreans are not going to give up their nuclear weapons. It’s a non-starter.” The American national-security community is now nearly unanimous on this point, but the government cannot say so openly, because that would cede leverage in a future negotiation, and raise the risk that other countries will try to follow North Korea’s example. “Whether it’s pressuring, threatening, negotiating, or trying to leverage China, everybody’s tried all of that—and it’s not working,” Clapper said.</p>\n<p>Inside the Trump Administration, there is disagreement about how to handle North Korea. Shortly before Steve Bannon, the President’s former chief strategist, was fired, in August, he told an interviewer, “There’s no military solution here, <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/steve-bannon-unrepentant\">they got us</a>.” But Mattis and McMaster argue that Kim Jong Un must be contained. Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee in June, Mattis called North Korea “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-northkorea/north-korea-most-urgent-threat-to-security-mattis-idUSKBN19407I\">the most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security</a>,” supplanting Russia as the No. 1 threat to the U.S. In an e-mail, McMaster told me, “Their provocations seem likely to increase—not decrease—over time. The North Koreans have also proliferated just about every capability they’ve ever produced, including chemical weapons and a nuclear reactor. Then there’s the matter of what other countries do—in the region and beyond—when they see that a rogue regime developed nukes and got away with it.”</p>\n<p>Experts can’t say definitively why Kim wants nuclear weapons. Are they for self-defense, as North Korea claims, or will Kim use them to achieve the unfulfilled ambition of the Korean War—forcing reunification with South Korea? A senior Administration official told me that members of Trump’s national-security team are not convinced that Kim will stop at self-protection. “There are fewer and fewer disagreements about North Korea’s capabilities now, and so then, inevitably, the question of their intentions becomes critical,” he said. “Are they pursuing these weapons in order to maintain the status quo on the Peninsula, or are they seeking to fundamentally alter the status quo?” The official added, “Sometimes dictators are able to kid themselves that ‘Hey, once I’ve got that weapon, I’m invincible, and I have a free hand to launch conventional wars and subversion and assassination campaigns against my neighbors.’ ”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The White House could try to deter North Korea from using or selling its weapons—or it could start a preventive war. Deterrence relies, at bottom, on the assumption that an adversary is not suicidal, but this Administration suspects that Kim’s recklessness could trigger his own destruction. The official said, “Saddam Hussein was not suicidal, but he committed suicide.” In 2003, as the U.S. threatened to attack Iraq, Saddam was surrounded by sycophants and cut off from reliable information. He doubted that America would actually launch a full-scale attack, and, as a result, he miscalculated the odds of destroying himself and his regime.</p>\n</section><section><p>A warm drizzle was falling on Pyongyang the morning after my arrival, as we left the Kobangsan Guest House to see the city. More than any other capital that has been marooned by politics—Havana or Rangoon or Caracas—Pyongyang presents a panorama from another time. Soviet-era Ladas and ancient city buses ply the streets, while passengers stick their heads out the windows in search of cool air. Buildings are adorned with Korean-language banners hailing the “Juche ideology,” the official state credo, which glorifies self-reliance and loyalty. On an embankment near a major intersection, workers in gray coveralls were installing an enormous red sign that praised the “immortal achievements of the esteemed Supreme Leader, comrade Kim Jong Un, who built the nuclear state of Juche, the leader in rocket power!”</p>\n<p>Pyongyang is a city of simulated perfection, without litter or graffiti—or, for that matter, anyone in a wheelchair. Its population, of 2.9 million, has been chosen for political reliability and physical health. The city is surrounded by checkpoints that prevent ineligible citizens from entering.</p>\n<p>For decades, there were few cars on the streets, but now frequent foreign visitors marvel at the growth in traffic. Pyongyang is the emptiest, quietest capital in Asia, but it is changing, slowly, driven by the legacy of famine. Between 1994 and 1998, a combination of mismanagement, droughts, and flooding paralyzed North Korean food production, killing up to three million people. Hundreds of thousands went to China in search of food and work, and many returned to their families having seen a better quality of life.</p>\n<p>Since the famine, “the majority of today’s North Koreans have learned to lead an economic double life in order to make ends meet,” according to “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/North-Korea-Confidential-Dissenters-Defectors/dp/0804844585/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504821956&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=North+Korea+Con%EF%AC%81dential\">North Korea Confidential</a>,” a study of markets and daily life, by Daniel Tudor and James Pearson. North Koreans, outside their state-assigned jobs, sell homemade noodles in thriving markets; they drive private buses; they rent out apartments by the hour for courting couples. Government insiders import housewares, medicine, and luxury products from China, giving rise to an entrepreneurial élite known as <em>donju</em>—“masters of money.” Kim has allowed limited economic reforms, letting people accumulate profits, which has fuelled the growth of black markets, including in real estate. Officially, there is no private homeownership, but, in practice, people pay for better units. An ordinary one-bedroom apartment in Pyongyang costs three or four thousand dollars; the most luxurious offerings sell for hundreds of thousands.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The weak enforcement of sanctions, and continued demand from China and Russia, has allowed North Korea’s economy to grow with surprising speed in recent years. According to South Korea’s central bank, North Korea’s G.D.P. grew an estimated 3.9 per cent in 2016, the fastest pace since 1999. (South Korea’s, by comparison, grew 2.8 per cent.)</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b1ac287ae17e19caf063a2}}--></div><p>On the streets of Pyongyang, there are flashes of modernity, even style. Some women can be seen wearing stilettos and short skirts, though these can be no higher than two inches above the knee, according to Workers’ Party regulations. (Jeans are still practically taboo, because of their association with America.) Now and then, I saw people hunched over cell phones. Since 2013, Pyongyang has had 3G mobile service, but most people have access only to North Korea’s self-contained intranet, which allows them to send e-mail inside the country and to look at some Web sites. But many North Koreans have had some exposure to Chinese, American, and South Korean entertainment, smuggled over the border on SD cards that are small enough to be inserted into a phone. (Kim Jong Un, sensing the danger that information poses, has denounced foreign movies and music as “poisonous weeds.” In 2015, his government warned that people caught with illegal videos could face ten years of hard labor.)</p>\n<p>“The regime does not really want the living standards to rise fast and too much, because that could shake the nation,” Alexandre Mansourov, a North Korea analyst who earned an advanced degree at Kim Il Sung University and served as a Soviet diplomat in Pyongyang in the nineteen-eighties, told me. “It’s the revolution of rising expectations. They want to manage that.” Kim Jong Un promotes economic growth on his own terms. Every year since assuming power, he has unveiled a new residential complex in the capital, as well as theatres, a water park, and a new airport. This past spring, he attended the opening of more than three thousand new apartments on Ryomyong Street, and Mr. Pak was eager to show off the buildings. The green-and-white complex, which includes a seventy-story high-rise, has circular columns and bulging round balconies that give it a “Jetsons”-like look.</p>\n<p>I passed couples whispering on park benches, and a grandmother following a toddler across fresh asphalt. A black Lexus, buffed to a high shine, honked its way through pedestrians. (Officially, most private cars are provided as gifts from the Supreme Leader, but insiders acquire cars by registering them in the names of state enterprises.) We came upon a van fitted with oversized loudspeakers on its roof. Pak said that the message being played was a “warning about American aggression.” He explained, “We have a propaganda unit in every district.” Nobody seemed to be paying much attention.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>I spent ten years abroad as a foreign correspondent, mostly in China, Egypt, and Iraq, but little of that experience is comparable to reporting in North Korea. Based on my requests, the government gave me an itinerary and then escorted me from place to place. A reporter cannot venture out into the city or the countryside independently without risking detention or compromising the safety of any North Korean who coöperates. But the country has become incrementally more open to scholars and reporters. In 2000, journalists who accompanied Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a visit travelled on a bus with covered windows and were warned not to take photographs. Today, the constraints are more subtle. I asked to visit an ordinary apartment in Pyongyang—any apartment—and was told that it was “too late to be arranged.”</p>\n<p>I’d asked to see some schools, so I was taken to the Pyongyang Orphans’ Secondary School—a brand-new brick-and-steel complex with an Astro-Turf field for four hundred lucky pupils. The principal, Pak Yong Chul, ushered me into a permanent exhibition on the ground floor, dedicated to the two-hour visit that Kim paid to the school on July 2, 2016. The walls of the exhibition are lined with photographs of Kim in his signature gray suit, striding through the facilities, holding an unlit cigarette between his fingers. On a large wall map, a red dashed line marked Kim’s route through the corridors. The students visit the exhibition every month, to “move along in the footprints of the Supreme Leader,” the principal said.</p>\n<p>I stood in front of a large photo of Kim touching a fuzzy red blanket. The principal stepped aside, and, with a flourish, revealed, in a Plexiglas box, the blanket. “He personally touched it,” he said. So it was with other specimens—the white painted chair that he blessed with his presence in the lunchroom; the simple wooden chair from the language lab, on which he rested from his labors—all preserved under glass, like the relics of a saint. I asked Pak Yong Chul how it felt to be visited by the leader, and his eyes widened. “That moment is unforgettable. I would never have dreamed of it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Upstairs, I stopped by a history class, where ten- and eleven-year-old students sat in perfect rows. I introduced myself as an American and asked if anyone had a question for me. After a long pause, a skinny boy with two medals pinned to his chest stood and asked, “Why is America trying to provoke a war with us? And what right do they have to block us from building our own nuclear weapon?” This did not seem the occasion for rigorous analysis or debate. I mumbled some bromides about hoping that things would get better. The boy seemed unimpressed.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<h2>II. A Marxist Emperor</h2>\n</section><section><p>Before Kim’s accession, in 2011, he was almost completely unknown, even inside the country. His name had first appeared in the state press a couple of years earlier. The C.I.A. had little more than a single photo of him—as an eleven-year-old, according to Sue Mi Terry, a former Korea analyst at the agency. In 2008, when Kim Jong Il suffered a stroke, Randal Phillips, a senior C.I.A. officer overseeing operations in Asia, met a Chinese counterpart to share analyses, as they sometimes did. But Phillips discovered that Chinese intelligence “didn’t know what was happening,” he told me. “I think the Chinese know a hell of a lot less than people assume.” Compared with other American adversaries, North Korea is the “hardest target,” Terry said. “There’s no other country that’s like that,” she told me. “It’s just pieced together.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/59b1e270b2b7cc134fe03618}}--></div><p>Kim Jong Il suffered a heart attack, and died in December, 2011. At the funeral, Kim Jong Un, the second youngest of his seven children, appeared pale and childlike, weeping as his father lay in an open casket. Afterward, he led the pallbearers, including spy chiefs and Army bosses, decades his senior. Some prominent analysts predicted that Kim would not be as secure in his power as his grandfather and father had been; his regime could succumb to a coup or could implode for other reasons. Victor Cha, who had been George W. Bush’s lead adviser on Korea, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/opinion/will-north-korea-become-chinas-newest-province.html\">wrote in an Op-Ed in the <em>Times</em></a>, “North Korea as we know it is over.” Cha told me recently, “I thought he would not last for more than a couple of years.”</p>\n<p>At first, Kim worked under the guidance of three Party elders who served as “regents,” according to Ken Gause, a specialist in North Korean politics at the Center for Naval Analyses, a nonprofit research group in Washington. Kim and his mentors made shrewd choices that helped to establish his authority. Physically, he transformed himself into a near-reincarnation of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, who was much more popular than Kim Jong Il. He bore a natural likeness to his grandfather, and, to accentuate it, he gained weight, cut his hair in a shorn-sided pompadour, and began wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a panama hat. (When foreign media suggested that he had undergone surgery to enhance the similarity, the state news agency condemned the speculation as “sordid hackwork by rubbish media.”)</p>\n<p>Politically, Kim put himself forward as a more candid and practical leader. His father never permitted discussion of flaws in the socialist paradise, but in April, 2012, Kim acknowledged the failure of a rocket that, upon launch, quickly crumbled into the Yellow Sea. The next month, during a televised inspection of the Mangyongdae amusement park, he made a show of bending down to pull weeds from the sidewalk, and chastising the managers: “How could you not see these? How could you be so negligent and complacent?”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Kim gradually shed the control of his regents and presented himself as a socialist of the modern age—he was seen in the North Korean media flying on a luxuriously appointed Ilyushin jet, typing on a MacBook, and enjoying an amusement-park ride at the Rungna People’s Pleasure Ground. He appeared in public with his wife, a stylish former cheerleader named Ri Sol Ju, whom he married in 2009. (They are believed to have three children.) As always, the propagandists were attentive: foreign analysts who track the use of Photoshop on North Korean state images say that official pictures of Kim are often altered around his ears, possibly to mask some sort of blemish.</p>\n<p>Kim also sought to convey an ease with brutality, and embarked on North Korea’s most violent Party purge in decades. He executed two of his father’s seven senior pallbearers—<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/world/asia/north-korea-says-uncle-of-executed.html\">his uncle Jang Song Thaek</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/world/asia/north-korea-removes-its-army-chief-from-all-his-posts.html\">Army chief Ri Yong Ho</a>—and expelled three others. His father had also executed senior cadres when he came to power, but killing Jang, an influential family member with deep ties to China, was an act of extraordinary boldness. The charges against Jang ranged from “treachery” to applauding “halfheartedly” when Kim entered the room. Many of Jang’s children and aides were also put to death, in ways that were intended to capture attention. Some were killed by flamethrowers; others were shot by anti-aircraft guns before outdoor audiences. (Media reports that Jang himself was fed to dogs proved to be false. He was executed by firing squad.)</p>\n<p>Evan Medeiros, who was President Obama’s chief Asia adviser, told me that Kim Jong Il’s “approach to managing élites appeared to be more incentive-based than coercion-based, making sure that they all got goodies and spoils.” He went on, “The son’s approach appears to be ‘If you screw with me, I’m just going to kill you—and I’m going to kill you in a really nasty way.’ ”</p>\n<p>That principle was expressed most dramatically earlier this year. The target was Kim’s estranged half brother, Kim Jong Nam, who had been living in semi-exile in Macau for more than a decade. In recent years, Kim Jong Nam had given interviews that were critical of the young leader, telling Yoji Gomi, a Japanese journalist, that North Korea was “likely to become weak under the third generation.” In a fateful comment, he called his half brother “just a figurehead.”</p>\n<p>On the morning of February 13th, Kim Jong Nam was at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, in Malaysia. At home in Macau, the Chinese government provided security guards, but he travelled alone. An airport security camera captured his arrival and movements. He wore jeans and a summer blazer, and carried a backpack. As he stood before a check-in kiosk, two young women smeared liquid on his face, and then fled. Agitated, he approached a security guard. He grew dizzy and was taken to an airport clinic, where his condition rapidly deteriorated. In a photograph, he is slumped in a chair, arms splayed, eyes closed. He died in an ambulance, less than twenty minutes after the attack. Based on samples taken from his eyes and skin, Malaysian authorities accused North Korea of its first known assassination by the nerve agent VX, a tasteless, odorless chemical weapon. South Korean and Japanese media reported that he may have enraged his brother by preparing to defect or by aiding foreign intelligence services.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/59b1e270f9b5710db7cd91ee}}--></div><p>The killing caused a diplomatic crisis: North Korea demanded the return of the body and of several North Korean citizens, who were sought by police for questioning. When those demands were refused, North Korea sealed its borders to departing Malaysians, trapping nine embassy workers and their families. After two weeks, Malaysia released Kim Jong Nam’s body, and North Korea allowed the workers and their families to leave. The two women involved in the attack, who face first-degree-murder charges, are in custody in Malaysia; they have told investigators that they worked in local night clubs and were paid ninety dollars each for what they thought was a TV-show prank. After the attack, the women washed their hands, suggesting that they may have been given separate, harmless chemical components that became toxic when mixed together. They are scheduled to go on trial in October.</p>\n<p>Six years into Kim Jong Un’s reign, some analysts in Seoul argue that senior Party officials can overrule or direct him, but U.S. intelligence believes that Kim is in sole command. The assassination of the half brother could not have happened without Kim’s approval, a U.S. official who works on Korea told me. “He’s the top decider, you might say,” the official said. “He’s the only guy that counts.” Many analysts worry that, as Kim moves deeper into confrontation with America, he does not have advisers who speak candidly to him. “We can’t identify an internal or external channel of information flow that’s effective in communicating the risks of the course that he’s on,” Scott Snyder, a Korea specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. “What general is going to be willing to risk his stars, if not his life, in order to tell Kim Jong Un he’s doing the wrong thing?”</p>\n<p>The U.S. has investigated the question of Kim Jong Un’s hold on power and has found no evidence of a potential coup or a challenge from disaffected élites. At the moment, Kim’s most visible vulnerability is his health: he is overweight and perhaps diabetic. In North Korea, the leader’s health is closely monitored by an agency called the Longevity Research Institute. Barring the unforeseen, Kim could rule North Korea for decades.</p>\n</section><section><p>On the way to lunch one afternoon in Pyongyang, I noticed that the latest American threats had already been inscribed on the cityscape. A full-color billboard depicted a barrage of missiles descending on a bombed-out shell of the U.S. Capitol. Across the wreckage of Washington, it said, according to Pak’s translation, “Preëmptive Strike” and “Military Option.”</p>\n<p>In the days after the President’s “locked and loaded” remarks, the U.S., following the doctrine of a standoff, was seeking to convey ambiguity—the sense that North Korea should tread carefully, because it doesn’t know what might trigger a violent American response. But the message was getting garbled en route to Pyongyang. That morning, we had awoken to discover that Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had published a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/were-holding-pyongyang-to-account-1502660253\">joint op-ed in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> that was clearly an attempt to ratchet down the tension. They wrote, “The U.S. has no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Pak, who is one of the government’s seasoned interpreters of American media, had a hard time following it all. In the car, he turned and asked, “How common is this, for the Secretary of State and the Defense Secretary to write a joint editorial?” Not very common, I said. He nodded, and turned back around. He could not understand how the two Cabinet members could so clearly contradict the President. At other points during the week, Pak tried to clear up some confusing details about the American media. “So the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> is conservative?” he asked. The editorial page is conservative, I said, but the news coverage is straight. He took this in and nodded again.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, Pak misread something that was hard to discern from far away. He told me, “The United States is a divided country. It has no appetite for war.” On some level, that was true—the United States is a divided country, and it is tired of fighting wars in the Middle East, in South Asia—but he would be wrong to assume that these facts would, with absolute assurance, prevent the Trump Administration from launching a strike on North Korea.</p>\n<p>We pulled up to a large blue-and-white boat that doubles as a restaurant, moored on the banks of the Taedong River. A sign over the entrance memorialized two visits by the Supreme Leader: “General duty ship Moojige received on-the-spot guidance by the esteemed comrade Kim Jong Un.” The restaurant’s distinguishing charm is that you can catch your own lunch in its tanks. On the way to our table, we passed a man standing on a ladder, holding a net, trying to nab a large fish with long whiskers. We reached a dining room where several tables were occupied by families, whose members ranged in age from a grandfather in a Mao-style suit to a couple of kids chasing each other around the table.</p>\n<p>We ordered beef, cold noodles, rice cakes, and sashimi. A television in the corner was tuned to the main state channel. Three other channels, devoted to sports, entertainment, and education, broadcast only occasionally. Pak said that we were watching a classic North Korean drama called “The Lighthouse.” He patiently explained the plot: “A man lived alone on a remote island with a lighthouse. Under the Japanese, he was like a slave, but, when the Great Leader Kim Il Sung came to power, he said this man should be acknowledged, and—”</p>\n<p>The movie cut off abruptly and a matronly news anchor appeared on the screen.</p>\n<p>“There’s news,” Pak said.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b17ab3ca83d16b77061231}}--><!--{{/photos/59b17ab55f57c60ce95c4f9c}}--></div></div><p>The broadcast showed photographs of Kim Jong Un in a dark pin-striped suit, surrounded by military men in uniform. The announcer reported that the missile unit had been tasked with preparing to strike the Pacific Ocean near Guam. Another photograph showed Kim beside a screen bearing a satellite image of Andersen Air Force Base, in Guam. The announcer quoted Kim as saying that he “would watch a little more of the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees” before making his final decision to launch. The segment ended with orchestral music over a video montage of missiles shooting from a launch pad, rockets blazing out of their launchers, and soldiers cheering as fighter jets screamed overhead. I glanced around the room and noticed that the other diners were engrossed in lunch.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>I was confused. “So is he going to launch them or not?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” Pak said. “It depends on whether the United States sends another nuclear asset, like a B-1B, over the Korean Peninsula.”</p>\n<p>“Does the U.S. know that’s the determining factor?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t told them! But they <em>should</em> know, because we said they should not send any further ‘nuclear provocations.’ ”</p>\n<p>The mentions of war and weaponry were everywhere: on television, on billboards, in the talk of well-rehearsed schoolchildren. When I attended a show at Pyongyang’s Rungna Dolphinarium, in which dolphins flipped and jumped and performed tricks, the finale featured a video montage that included the image of a missile soaring across the sky. I asked Pak what connected dolphins with missiles. He said, “It’s inspiring to the people. We’re going to have everything we want. A dolphinarium. Nuclear weapons. One by one.”</p>\n<p>At lunch, I asked Pak, “If your country would be destroyed in a nuclear exchange, why are you really entertaining the idea?”</p>\n<p>North Korea, he said, is no stranger to devastation: “We’ve been through it twice before. The Korean War and the Arduous March”—the official euphemism for the famine of the mid-nineties. “We can do it a third time.” The argument is embedded in North Koreans’ self-image. They are taught to see themselves as inhabitants of a land shaped by a history of suffering, a sense of hostile encirclement, and a do-or-die insistence on survival.</p>\n<p>But, to state the obvious, I said, risking a premature end to a friendly meal, a nuclear exchange would not be comparable.</p>\n<p>“A few thousand would survive,” Pak said. “And the military would say, ‘Who cares? As long as the United States is destroyed, then we are all starting from the same line again.’ ” He added, “A lot of people would die. But not <em>everyone</em> would die.”</p>\n</section><section><p>“We must envelop our environment in a dense fog,” Kim Jong Il once said, “to prevent our enemies from learning anything about us.” As a result, interested parties have to be creative. The South Korean intelligence service employs lip-readers to watch what Kim says away from the microphones at political events. To chart who is gaining and losing power, American scholars and analysts, like Cold War Kremlinologists, monitor the choreography of official funerals and dissect photo captions and propaganda reports. Over time, those efforts have started to cut through the fog around North Korea’s first family.</p>\n<p>The Kim dynasty began in 1945, after the defeat of Japan. In a hasty redrawing of the map, the Americans and the Soviets divided the Korean Peninsula; in effect, each would control half. The Soviets installed Kim Il Sung, a nationalist guerrilla who had been living in the Soviet Union, as the leader of North Korea. After the humiliations of occupation and war, Kim presented himself as a Marxist emperor of sorts, who would revive Korea’s racial superiority and rebuild the nation as a fortress, impenetrable to imperialists. He restricted the entry of foreigners and curtailed his people’s freedom to leave or dissent. As he aged, Kim Il Sung sought to avoid the havoc that followed the deaths of Stalin and Mao by appointing his son as his successor, in the first hereditary transition in the Communist world. But Kim Jong Il, who assumed power in 1994, was not a natural demagogue. He was a cinéaste, plump and sedentary, who made his own version of “Godzilla.” (His favorite films also included “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rambo-Widescreen-Sylvester-Stallone/dp/B0015XHP2C\">Rambo</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gone-Wind-Disc-70th-Anniversary/dp/B002M2Z3BA/\">Gone with the Wind</a>.”)</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Kim Jong Il grew isolated and paranoid. He allowed his voice to be heard in public only once, when he said, at a 1992 parade, “Glory be to the heroic soldiers of the Korean People’s Army!” On foreign trips, his aides brought home his feces and urine, to prevent foreign powers from hijacking the waste and evaluating his health. He was five feet two inches tall, and insecure about his height. In 1978, he ordered the kidnapping of his favorite South Korean actress, Choi Eun-hee, and greeted her by saying, “Small as a midget’s turd, aren’t I?” (Choi was forced to act in North Korean films until 1986, when, during a trip to Vienna, she escaped.) Jang Jin-sung, a poet and a high-ranking propagandist who defected to South Korea in 2004, told me that, when he was brought to meet Kim Jong Il, an aide instructed him, “Don’t look him in the eye. Look at the second button down from his collar.” Jang went on, “Before you met him, you were given a moist towelette to wash your hands and asked to remove your wristwatch or any metal in case it could do him harm.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/59b1e2703a561f262d7d5039}}--></div><p>And yet Kim Jong Il came closer than any other North Korean leader to forging peace with the United States and ending his country’s isolation. Madeleine Albright, the only U.S. Secretary of State who has visited Pyongyang, spent more than twelve hours with Kim over two days, in 2000, negotiating the terms of a deal regarding his missile program. She found him odd—he personally choreographed a dance that was performed for her delegation—but also pragmatic and well informed. When members of the delegation asked highly technical questions, he answered many of them without consulting experts. Wendy Sherman, a diplomat who accompanied Albright on the trip, and later became President Obama’s chief negotiator with Iran, sensed the single-mindedness that has driven North Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. “We think in two-year, four-year, six-year time frames. They don’t. They’ve had a long-term vision since Kim Jong Il’s father, and they have stuck with it,” she told me.</p>\n<p>In the final months of the Clinton Administration, Albright and Sherman believed that Kim was close to accepting a freeze on long-range missile tests. But the disputed election of 2000, and Clinton’s pursuit of a deal in the Middle East, consumed the Administration’s final weeks. They never returned to Pyongyang. Sherman told me, “If our team had gone, and if Kim agreed to our terms, I would have had a date in my pocket on which the President of the United States would have come.”</p>\n<p>Once in office, George W. Bush declined to reaffirm a Clinton-era communiqué that pledged “no hostile intent” toward North Korea. Then, in his <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/sou012902.htm\">2002 State of the Union address</a>, Bush included North Korea, along with Iran and Iraq, in his famous formulation, the “axis of evil.” The relationship has deteriorated ever since. In 2009, when Clinton visited Kim to secure the release of two imprisoned journalists, Kim lamented that, once Bush came in, “we found ourselves missing the earlier, better relationship with the previous Administration.” According to American notes from the meeting, which were <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/30/world/politics-diplomacy-world/hacked-memo-reveals-details-bill-clintons-2009-meeting-north-koreas-kim-jong-il/#.WbG13dOGOi4\">later divulged by WikiLeaks</a>, Kim added, “The United States would have had a new friend in Northeast Asia in a complex world.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>For all Kim Jong Il’s eccentricity, he cultivated his relationship with America in ways that his son has not. Jerrold Post, who founded the C.I.A.’s psychological-profile unit, and later studied Kim Jong Il’s decision-making, told me, “He always seemed to know the boundaries of his adversaries’ tolerance for provocation. He would go so far, then pull back just in time. He had finely tuned antennae.” Post said that he worries that Kim Jong Un has been thrust into a complicated scenario with little time to hone those skills. “His father had two decades in the wings before he formally took over,” Post said. “The son had two years.”</p>\n</section><section><p>There was nothing preordained about which of Kim Jong Il’s children would run the country. Evans Revere, the former Korea expert at the State Department, said that Kim Jong Un became the successor largely on the basis of attitude and aggression. When Kim was a child, he would wear a Soviet military uniform on his birthday. The palace staff took to calling him Comrade General. He gave off an “inner strength,” according to Kenji Fujimoto, a Japanese chef who spent part of his time as a playmate for the children. Fujimoto, who later wrote a memoir, entitled “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kim-Jong-North-Koreas-Leader/dp/0470821310\">Kim Jong Il’s Chef</a>,” gave the young Kim video games and remote-controlled cars as gifts and, because the boy loved basketball, arranged for his sister to send VHS tapes of Chicago Bulls games.</p>\n<p>In 1996, Kim joined a brother, Jong Chul, in Bern, Switzerland; they stayed with an aunt. At school there, Kim went by a pseudonym, Pak Un, and was introduced to other students as the son of the North Korean Ambassador. “One day, he said to me, ‘Yeah, I am the son of the leader of North Korea.’ But I didn’t believe him, because it was a normal school,” his classmate João Micaelo recalled, in a television interview. “He was very quiet. He didn’t speak with anyone. Maybe it was because most of the people, they didn’t take the time to understand him. He was competitive at sports. He didn’t like to lose, like every one of us. For him, basketball was everything.” Kim drew pictures of Michael Jordan and slept with a basketball, according to Ko Yong Suk, the aunt who cared for him. She took him skiing in the Alps, swimming on the French Riviera, and to the Disney park in Paris. He showed flashes of stubbornness. If he was scolded for not studying, he’d refuse to eat. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-secret-life-of-kim-jong-uns-aunt-who-has-lived-in-the-us-since-1998/2016/05/26/522e4ec8-12d7-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_story.html?utm_term=.a9c1d4a332c1\">Ko told the Washington <em>Post</em></a> last year. (She and her husband defected to the U.S. and now run a dry-cleaning business, under assumed names.)</p>\n<p>When it came time for Kim Jong Il to choose an heir, his four daughters were ineligible, because of their gender. His eldest son, Jong Nam, was more a playboy than a statesman, and, in 2001, he was caught trying to enter Japan on a forged passport, to take his four-year-old son to Tokyo Disneyland. The next-oldest son, Jong Chul, was reserved and gentle. While in Switzerland, he had written a poem called “My Ideal World,” which began, “If I had my ideal world I would not allow weapons and atom bombs anymore. I would destroy all terrorists with the Hollywood star Jean-Claude Van Damme.” According to Fujimoto, Kim Jong Il said that Jong Chul was unfit to rule “because he is like a little girl.” (He now works as an aide to his brother, and is thought to be his natural successor.)</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b17ab65f57c60ce95c4f9e}}--></div><p>That left Jong Un, who had received a degree in physics from Kim Il Sung University, had trained as an artillery officer, and was active in security and political work. In 2009, North Korea specialists began hearing that Jong Un, then twenty-five, was the likely successor. “He had never been in charge of anything, had never checked any of the boxes that you would normally expect someone to check on their way up through the ranks,” Revere said. “But clearly he had some personality characteristics and traits that appealed to his father, and those included a level of authority and aggression and self-confidence—some traits that his father didn’t have.”</p>\n<p>Before assuming power, Kim involved himself in a brazen military operation that provided a preview of his tolerance for risk, according to U.S. intelligence. In March, 2010, the North torpedoed a South Korean naval vessel, the Cheonan, killing forty-six personnel. It also shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two people. These acts could have generated a fierce response, but, in the end, Seoul did not retaliate.</p>\n<p>Alexandre Mansourov, the former Soviet diplomat in Pyongyang, told me that Kim’s role in the attacks reassured élites that he wasn’t averse to confrontation. “It was domestic positioning,” Mansourov said. “He needed to prove to them and his father that he could stand up.” That fall, Kim was promoted to the rank of general and made his first public appearance by his father’s side, signalling to the world that he was the chosen successor.</p>\n<p>In his rapid rise, Kim acquired defining habits of mind. Mansourov said, “He’s a person who was never told no. Nobody drew the red line, and said, ‘Not a step further.’ Nobody punched him in the face, made him feel hurt. We say, ‘A man begins to grow his wisdom tooth when he bites more than he can chew.’ With Kim Jong Un, he has never yet bitten more than he can chew. Whatever he sets his sights on he gets. He keeps pushing, and pushing, and pushing. We don’t know where his brakes are, and I suspect he doesn’t know where he can stop.”</p>\n<h2>III. “Single-Hearted Unity”</h2>\n</section><section><p>After a couple of days in Pyongyang, I was eager to get some glimpses of life beyond the capital. My minders agreed to an outing. Up before dawn, we climbed into the Toyota and headed toward the demilitarized zone, which marks the border with South Korea. Leaving Pyongyang, we passed through a checkpoint, and smooth asphalt eventually gave way to potholes brimming with rainwater. The nation’s wealth and modernity, such as it is, is largely limited to the capital. The road emptied first of cars, then of bicycles, until we passed only clusters of farmers. A woman balancing a load on her head walked along railroad tracks to a point unseen. Without the industrial haze that hovers over much of East Asia, the North Korean landscape is an incandescent green. Eighty per cent of the country is mountainous. (American military planners liken the terrain to Afghanistan’s.)</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>We stopped to stretch our legs beside a closed restaurant and spotted two busloads of foreign tourists. On September 1st, American tourists would be banned from visiting North Korea, under a State Department order prompted by the death of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who had been convicted of “a hostile act against the state,” for trying to remove a propaganda poster from the wall of a hotel in Pyongyang. In June, American officials, having discovered that Warmbier had been in a coma for more than a year, secured his release. He died six days after returning home.</p>\n<p>I mentioned the upcoming ban, and Pak said that it was a pity, because, after years of internal deliberations, North Korea had been preparing to accept more foreign visitors. “The military used to be very unhappy about tourists coming here, because they might see the secrets of what we’re doing,” he said. “But now we have gained strength.”</p>\n<p>In recent months, I’d spoken to American negotiators involved in Warmbier’s case, and they questioned why it had ended tragically. (In the past two decades, at least sixteen Americans have been detained while visiting North Korea, but no others have suffered as much harm.) Warmbier was arrested in January, 2016. After a show trial, he was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor. Pyongyang reported that Warmbier contracted botulism, was given a sedative, and entered a coma. But doctors in Cincinnati who treated him after his release found no traces of botulism. Many North Korea specialists wondered if he fell ill and was given a catastrophic overdose of medication. Others suspected that he was beaten or interrogated to the point of collapse, but that would be out of the ordinary; most American detainees in North Korea are not beaten, because they are considered bargaining chips.</p>\n<p>Negotiators for the Warmbier family, such as Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, had been frustrated in their efforts, and I asked Pak why the government had stonewalled them. Pak blamed an Obama Administration decision, in July, 2016, to impose personal sanctions on Kim Jong Un and other top officials. “Obama blacklisted our leaders, and smeared them by name,” Pak said. “At that point, we could not accept it. We cut off the New York channel and we adopted wartime measures. From then on, we said, the situation will stay as is.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b17ab73a561f262d7d4b74}}--><!--{{/photos/59b17ab9ca83d16b77061233}}--></div></div><p>I told him that Warmbier’s death had done more damage to North Korea’s reputation in the U.S. than he probably realized. Pak was unmoved. “He broke our rules, and we take that very seriously,” he said. That morning, the news from America was about the racist demonstrations in Charlottesville, and Pak explained, “In the D.P.R.K., the military thinks Americans come here and try to do whatever they want, like white supremacists are doing in the United States.” (Three Americans are still detained in North Korea: Kim Dong-chul was convicted of spying and is serving a ten-year sentence; Kim Hak-song and Tony Kim are being held on unspecified charges.)</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>By midmorning, we had reached the D.M.Z., an open gash across the Peninsula, a remnant of the Korean War. For most Americans, the war is overshadowed by other dramas of the twentieth century, but it’s impossible to understand North Korea’s hostility toward the U.S. today without looking at the history. In June, 1950, North Korea, seeking to unify the Peninsula under Communism, invaded the South. The United States and China entered the war on opposing sides, and by 1953 President Eisenhower had concluded that the conflict had reached a stalemate. That July, after more than four million people had been killed, the sides signed a ceasefire, but not a peace treaty.</p>\n<p>The regime’s efforts to cultivate paranoia and contempt for America are rooted in the scale and the devastation of the bombing during the war. Dean Rusk, who later became Secretary of State, recalled, in an oral history in 1985, that the United States bombed “every brick that was standing on top of another, everything that moved.” General Curtis LeMay, the head of the Strategic Air Command during the Korean War, told the Office of Air Force History in 1984, “Over a period of three years or so, we killed off—what—twenty per cent of the population.” After the ceasefire, each side walked back two thousand metres, creating the D.M.Z., a buffer zone two and a half miles wide. Large numbers of troops are stationed on both sides, and outbreaks of violence have killed several hundred soldiers over the years. In the most recent incident, in August, 2015, two South Korean soldiers were wounded by land mines.</p>\n<p>The Korean People’s Army assigned Lieutenant Colonel Pang Myong Jin to show me around. Pang is in his late thirties, with prominent cheekbones and a sharp chin. He wore a green uniform and an officer’s cap as broad as a dinner plate. We drove down a narrow road, through a gap in the tank traps and the barbed wire, to a clearing in the forest, which the North Koreans have turned into a shrine, called the North Korea Peace Museum. In their version of the conflict, the United States started the Korean War; the singular leadership of Kim Il Sung led to a humiliating defeat of the Americans, who have tried, ever since, to provoke another war. “This was the first time that the U.S. was defeated by the Korean people,” Pang told me. He led me to a tall stone tablet with a Korean inscription:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The great leader, Comrade Kim Jong Il, visited this spot four times, including on July 19, 1972. The esteemed high commander, Comrade Kim Jong Un, visited on March 3, 2012. They taught us the valuable lesson of preserving and passing on this historic site—where invading Americans knelt before the people in surrender—to the next generation, in a reunified homeland.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every country valorizes its war record, but North Korea’s mythology—the improbable victory, the divine wisdom of the Kim family, and America’s enduring weakness and hostility—has shaped its conception of the present to a degree that is hard for the rest of the world to understand. In something close to a state religion, North Korea tells its people that their nation may be small, but its unique “single-hearted unity” would crush a beleaguered American military. That’s a volatile notion. Robert Jervis, a Columbia University political scientist, who studies the origins of war, once observed, “War is most likely if you overestimate others’ hostility but underestimate their capabilities.” It can be hard to know where North Korea’s reverie ends and realism resumes.</p>\n<p>At our last stop, we drove through a grove of ginkgo trees, and arrived at a blue-painted hut that straddles the border with South Korea. North Korean guards in helmets watched us approach. When the two sides hold negotiations, they meet at a heavy wooden table that sits in both countries. I took a seat. “The microphones are the dividing line,” Pang said. I walked across the hut to stand, for a moment, in South Korea. When we stepped back outside, Pang said, “This is a very dangerous place, but the respected leader came here during the military exercises, at the highest level of tension. Do you think Trump would dare to come here?”</p>\n<p>Yes, I said. He looked disappointed.</p>\n<p>I asked Pang if he thinks the U.S. and North Korea will find themselves at war again. He reminded me that Kim had threatened to fire missiles into the Pacific Ocean. “We will fire a warning shot at Guam, and if that doesn’t work then we will fire a warning shot at the mainland United States. We want to achieve world peace, but if this isn’t possible then we are prepared for war.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b17abb25d70e5281a9bf77}}--></div><p>If you fire at Guam, I asked, how do you expect the U.S. to respond? He thought for a moment. It was quiet, except for the drone of cicadas. Then Pang cited a comment by Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/sen-lindsey-graham-trump-says-war-north-korea-option-n788396\">in a recent appearance on the “Today” show</a>, which had filtered through translations and reached Pang more or less intact. Graham recounted his conversations with Trump, in which the President said he was prepared to strike Korea because the casualties will be “over there.”</p>\n<p>“Trump said if there is war, then it will happen in the D.P.R.K., not in the U.S.,” Pang said. “So clearly he is preparing for war. He understands what he’s saying.”</p>\n</section><section><p>What, exactly, are America’s options with North Korea? Many Korea specialists in Washington favor a major increase in pressure tactics, known as “strategic strangulation.” The U.S. would expand the use of cyber hacking and other covert methods to disrupt missile development and unnerve the government; it would flood the North with smuggled flash drives loaded with uncensored entertainment and information. It would also attempt to close off North Korea’s illicit trade networks, by interdicting ships, expanding sanctions against Chinese companies, and freezing the assets of individual leaders. “Make hundreds of millions of dollars of North Korean deposits in a Swiss bank disappear,” Evans Revere said. “The goal of this is not to cause the collapse of the regime. The goal of this is to convince the North Koreans that collapse is just over the horizon, and, if Kim Jong Un is a rational actor, then he will understand that.” Critics of the plan say that North Korea has perfected its ability to absorb pain, and that the plan is not fundamentally different from what previous Administrations have attempted.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>There is also scattered support for a less confrontational option, a short-term deal known as a “freeze for freeze.” North Korea would stop weapons development in exchange for a halt or a reduction in U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Proponents say that a freeze, which could be revoked if either side cheats, is hardly perfect, but the alternatives are worse. Critics say that versions of it have been tried, without success, and that it will damage America’s alliance with the South. Thus far the Trump Administration has no interest. “The idea that some have suggested, of a so-called ‘freeze for freeze,’ is insulting,” Nikki Haley, the U.N. Ambassador, <a href=\"https://usun.state.gov/remarks/7953\">said before the Security Council on September 4th</a>. “When a rogue regime has a nuclear weapon and an ICBM pointed at you, you do not take steps to lower your guard.”</p>\n<p>Outside the Administration, the more people I talked to, the more I heard a strong case for some level of diplomatic contact. When Obama dispatched James Clapper to Pyongyang, in 2014, to negotiate the release of two prisoners, Clapper discovered that North Korea had misread the purpose of the trip. The government had presumed that he was coming in part to open a new phase in the relationship. “They were bitterly disappointed,” he said. Clapper’s visit convinced him that the absence of diplomatic contact is creating a dangerous gulf of misperception. “I was blown away by the siege mentality—the paranoia—that prevails among the leadership of North Korea. When we sabre-rattle, when we fly B-1s accompanied by jet escorts from the Republic of Korea and Japan, it makes us feel good, it reassures the allies, but what we don’t factor in is the impact on the North Koreans.”</p>\n<p>Clapper went on, “I think that what we should do is consider seriously, in consultation with South Korea, establishing an interest section in Pyongyang much like we had in Havana for decades, to deal with a government that we didn’t recognize. If we had a permanent presence in Pyongyang, I wonder whether the outcome of the tragedy of Otto Warmbier might have been avoided. Secondly, it would provide on-scene insight into what is actually going on in North Korea—intelligence.”</p>\n<p>It is a measure of how impoverished America’s contact with North Korea has become that one of the best-known conduits is Dennis Rodman, a.k.a. the Worm, the bad boy of the nineties-era Chicago Bulls. Rodman’s agent, Chris Volo, a hulking former mixed-martial-arts fighter, told me recently, “I’ve been there four times in four years. I’m in the Korean Sea, and I’m saying to myself, ‘No one would believe that I’m alone right now, riding Sea-Doos with Kim Jong Un.’ ” Rodman’s strange bond with Kim began in 2013, when Vice Media, aware of Kim’s love of the Bulls, offered to fly American basketball players to North Korea. Vice tried to contact Michael Jordan but got nowhere. Rodman, who was working the night-club autograph circuit, was happy to go. He joined three members of the Harlem Globetrotters for a game in Pyongyang. Kim made a surprise appearance, invited Rodman to dinner, and asked him to return to North Korea for a week at his private beach resort in Wonsan, which Rodman later described as “Hawaii or Ibiza, but he’s the only one that lives there.” On his most recent trip, in June, Rodman gave Kim English and Korean editions of Trump’s 1987 best-seller, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Art-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0399594493\">The Art of the Deal</a>.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<div class=\"callout\"><div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b17abcca83d16b77061235}}--><!--{{/photos/59b17abebabccf5ac602a72c}}--></div></div><p>Ultimately, the Trump Administration must decide if it can live with North Korea as a nuclear state. During the Cold War, the United States used deterrence, arms control, and diplomacy to coexist with a hostile, untrustworthy adversary. At its height, the Soviet Union had fifty-five thousand nuclear weapons. According to the <em class=\"small\">RAND</em> Corporation, the North Koreans are on track to have between fifty and a hundred by 2020; that would be less than half the size of Great Britain’s arsenal.</p>\n<p>Susan Rice, who served as Obama’s national-security adviser, argued, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/opinion/susan-rice-trump-north-korea.html?mcubz=3\">in a <em>Times</em> Op-Ed last month</a>, that the U.S. can “rely on traditional deterrence” to blunt North Korea’s threat. But McMaster is skeptical that the Soviet model can be applied to Pyongyang. He told me, “There are reasons why this situation is different from the one we were in with the Soviets. The North Koreans have shown, through their words and actions, their intention to blackmail the United States into abandoning our South Korean ally, potentially clearing the path for a second Korean War.”</p>\n<p>If the Administration were to choose a preventive war, one option is “decapitation,” an effort to kill senior leaders with a conventional or even a nuclear attack, though most analysts consider the risks unacceptable. Such a strike could rally the population around the regime and cause a surviving commander to respond with a nuclear weapon. Another option is akin to Israel’s 1981 stealth attack on the Osirak nuclear reactor, the linchpin of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear-weapons development, which set back Iraq’s pursuit of nuclear weapons by at least a decade. “That’s a textbook case of a preventive war,” the senior Administration official told me.</p>\n<p>But the comparison between Osirak and North Korea is limited. In 1981, Iraq had yet to make a bomb, and it had just one major nuclear target, which was isolated in the desert and relatively easy to eliminate. North Korea already has dozens of usable nuclear warheads, distributed across an unknown number of facilities, many of them hidden underground. Even destroying their missiles on the launch pad has become much harder, because the North has developed mobile launchers and solid-fuel missiles, which can be rolled out and fired with far less advance notice than older liquid-fuel missiles.</p>\n<p>The Obama Administration studied the potential costs and benefits of a preventive war intended to destroy North Korea’s nuclear weapons. Its conclusion, according to Rice, in the <em>Times</em>, was that it would be “lunacy,” resulting in “hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of casualties.” North Korea likely would retaliate with an attack on Seoul. The North has positioned thousands of artillery cannons and rocket launchers in range of the South Korean capital, which has a population of ten million, and other densely populated areas. (Despite domestic pressure to avoid confrontation, South Korea’s President, Moon Jae-in, has accepted the installation of an American missile-defense system called Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or <em class=\"small\">THAAD</em>.)</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Some two hundred thousand Americans live in South Korea. (Forty thousand U.S. military personnel are stationed in Japan, which would also be vulnerable.) A 2012 study of the risks of a North Korean attack on Seoul, by the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability, estimates that sixty-five thousand civilians would die on the first day, and tens of thousands more in the days that followed. If Kim used his stockpiles of sarin gas and biological weapons, the toll would reach the millions. U.S. and South Korean forces could eventually overwhelm the North Korean military, but, by any measure, the conflict would yield one of the worst mass killings in the modern age.</p>\n<p>In dozens of conversations this summer, in the United States and Asia, experts from across the political spectrum predicted that, despite the threats from Trump and McMaster, the U.S. most likely will accept the reality of North Korea as a nuclear state, and then try to convince Kim Jong Un that using—or selling—those weapons would bring about its annihilation. John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University, in Seoul, said, “If, one day, an American President comes along—maybe Trump—who understands the problem is the hostile relationship, and takes steps to improve it, then the slow train to denuclearization could leave the station.”</p>\n<p>Managing a nuclear North Korea will not be cheap. It will require stronger missile defenses in South Korea, Japan, Alaska, and Hawaii, and more investment in intelligence to track the locations of North Korea’s weapons, to insure that we pose a credible threat of destroying them. Scott Snyder, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said, “I think we’re going to end up in a situation where we live with a nuclear-capable North Korea, but it will be a situation that is incredibly dangerous. Because, at that point, any unexplained move that looks like it could involve preparations for a nuclear strike could precipitate an American preëmptive response.” Even that risk, by almost all accounts, is better than a war.</p>\n<h2>IV. “We’re Not Going to Die Alone”</h2>\n</section><section><p>On the morning of August 17th, I awoke and found a new tweet from @realDonaldTrump: “Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable.” What decision was the President referring to? After poking around online, I discovered that Trump had picked up on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/world/asia/south-korea-trump-north-korea.html?mcubz=3\">Kim’s comment</a> that he “would watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees” before deciding whether to fire missiles at Guam. To Trump, this was Kim standing down. He was pleased. (A few days later, Trump told a rally in Phoenix, “He is starting to respect us.”) But, it seemed, Trump was misreading the signals. “He only read one half of the statement,” Pak said, in frustration.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>That morning, I was scheduled to interview a senior diplomat named Jo Chol Su, who had served in the North Korean Embassy in Geneva before being assigned, recently, to work on the United States. We spoke at my hotel, seated in giant armchairs, beside an especially large pair of Kim portraits.</p>\n<p>Jo arrived with a young colleague to translate for us and carried a sheaf of printed remarks. Jo asked if he could begin with “an overview of the current situation and the history” of relations between our countries. He studied my face and added, “I’ll make it brief.” He spoke for seventeen minutes, blasting the latest sanctions and hailing the ICBMs as a new era. “Today, we’ve got everything we need in our hands, and it’s preposterous to think that new sanctions and new threats will change anything.”</p>\n<p>When he finished, I mentioned that, overnight, Trump had issued a tweet about Kim Jong Un. Jo looked stricken. There was nothing in his prepared remarks about it. He asked me to read it aloud, and he jotted it down as I read it. When I was done, Jo looked up and said, through his translator, “Once more, please.”</p>\n<p>I read the tweet again. Jo stared at his paper. After a pause, he reiterated some of his speech and then improvised: “The U.S. should put an end to its high-handed practices and unilateral compulsion toward the D.P.R.K. and just leave us alone.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/photos/59b17abf48d9d03e51d7f90b}}--></div><p>Jo wrapped up with a grand farewell. “I know that <em>The New Yorker</em> is very influential and I’ve received good feelings through our dialogue today,” the translator said. “I’d be grateful if you just write articles which are conducive to the improved bilateral relations between the D.P.R.K. and the U.S.”</p>\n<p>The three of us walked to the lobby. Jo lit a cigarette, ordered a coffee, and turned to me and said, in nearly perfect English, “I’m sorry—I should’ve asked first if you’d like a coffee. Can I order you one?”</p>\n<p>Diplomats, no matter what their language skills, often use a translator on formal occasions, but I was impressed by how swiftly Jo eased out of his official mask. We chatted, and I asked him if he’d been to the United States. Never, he said. I had wondered what it must be like to experience the United States through the fog of Twitter. It turned out that it wasn’t much different from Americans trying to make sense of North Korea through its propaganda.</p>\n</section><section><p>After breakfast one morning, Mr. Pak drove me to a subway station in downtown Pyongyang, and announced, “This is for the nuclear war.”</p>\n<p>By now, I was accustomed to his chipper declarations about an imminent cataclysm, but this one baffled me. He explained, “Everything here has a dual-use purpose.” He pointed to an underpass, beneath an intersection, which he said can serve as a shelter. In the back yards of apartment blocks, residents can take cover in storage cellars. Surrounded by commuters, we boarded an escalator, heading down to the station.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Built in the seventies, with Russian help, the Pyongyang Metro lies a hundred metres underground, nearly twice as far as the deepest platform in the New York City subway. Pyongyang stations are equipped with large blast doors. “During the Korean War, we were threatened by nukes,” Pak said. In 1950, President Truman raised the possibility of using the atomic bomb in Korea. “It touched our people’s minds,” he said, adding, “We don’t want that to happen again. And now we’ve got nukes and we can comfortably say, ‘Let’s do it.’ ”</p>\n<p>In the event of a nuclear war, American strategists assume that North Korea would first launch a nuclear or chemical weapon at an American military base in Japan or Guam, in the belief that the U.S. would then hold its fire, rather than risk a strike on its mainland. I mentioned that to Pak, but he countered with a different view. “The point of nuclear war is to give total destruction to another party,” he said. “There are no moves, no maneuvers. That’s a conventional war.”</p>\n<p>When we reached the subway platform, we were treated to patriotic orchestral music playing on the loudspeaker. Broadsheet newspaper pages were hung behind glass for people to read while they waited for the train. The scene reminded me of thirty-year-old photos I’ve seen of Beijing. We rode the train awhile, and then got on the escalator for the long ascent to the surface.</p>\n<p>I was glad to be back in the open air. We got in the Toyota, and Pak said, “If the U.S. puts sanctions and sanctions and sanctions and sanctions, if they drive us to the edge of the cliff, we will attack. That’s how the world wars have started.” He thought awhile and then said, “Don’t push us too hard, because you’re going to start a war. And we should say, we’re not going to die alone.”</p>\n<p>This was a familiar refrain. Some of the American officials in Washington who are immersed in the problem of North Korea frequently mention the old Korean saying “<em>Nuh jukgo, nah jukja!</em>” It means “You die, I die!” It’s the expression you hear in a barroom fight, or from an exasperated spouse—the notion that one party will go over the cliff if it will take the other down, too. Krys Lee, a Korean-American author and translator, said, “My mother also used it on me!” Lee finds that it’s hard for Americans and Koreans to gauge each other’s precise emotions, because Koreans tend to use “more abstract, dramatic, and sentimental language.” She has heard that many Korean literature students find Raymond Carver—the most laconic of American authors—“very dry, and that he didn’t translate well.”</p>\n</section><section><p>On my last morning in Pyongyang, I visited the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum. Shortly after Kim came to power, he renovated and expanded it; the museum is now nearly three-quarters the size of the Louvre. Choe Un Jong, a captain in the Korean People’s Army, showed me around. We were the only visitors. (It was a Friday, when, Choe said, the museum is open only to foreigners.) A tall woman in her twenties, Choe had stylish wavy hair that fell to her shoulders. She said, apologetically, “Today I cannot show you all of the museum. It takes three or four days.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>We stood beneath a three-story granite statue of a barrel-chested young Kim Il Sung, looking indistinguishable from his grandson. I told Choe that I had trouble telling their statues apart. She was thrilled. “Without any explanation, people think that that’s Marshal Kim Jong Un!” she said. The exhibits made use of life-size wax figures: there was a Korean commando crouching in the woods, and a dead American soldier with his eyes rolled back and a raven picking at his chest. We walked past captured howitzers and tanks, and a U.S. plane that she said delivered “germ bombs” loaded with “malaria, cholera, and typhoid.” (That claim has been widely debunked.) Choe sat me down for a video called “Who Started the Korean War?,” in which the narrator said, “The Korean War was precisely a direct product of the aggressive foreign policy of the United States to dominate the world.”</p>\n<p>The mythology was no surprise, but one exhibit contained a stark implication for the current crisis. Beside the museum, we boarded the U.S.S. Pueblo, a Navy spy ship that was captured in January, 1968, long after the end of the Korean War. The seizure—during a surge of hostilities not unlike the present—was an audacious gamble on North Korea’s part. One American crew member was killed and eighty-two were detained. Lyndon Johnson considered retaliating with a naval blockade or even a nuclear strike. But he was consumed by the war in Vietnam, and, in the end, he did not retaliate. After eleven months, the U.S. apologized for spying and won the release of the prisoners.</p>\n<p>The Pueblo incident nearly started a war, but Kim Il Sung drew a powerful, and potentially misleading, lesson from it. In a private conversation in 1971, Kim told Nicolae Ceaușescu, the Romanian President, that the Pueblo and other standoffs had convinced him that Washington backs down. “The Americans don’t want to continue this fight,” he said, according to documents in Romania’s state archives. “They let us know it’s not their intention to fight the Koreans again.”</p>\n<p>Van Jackson, a scholar of international relations who served in the Pentagon from 2009 to 2014, spent years analyzing the Kim family’s handling of crises, including the seizure of the Pueblo. The grandfather’s theory of victory still drives North Korea toward provocation, he said, but the regime also knows its limits; to survive, it chooses violence but avoids escalation. “When South Korea blares giant propaganda speakers at the North from the D.M.Z., North Korea fires warning shots nearby but doesn’t dare attack the speakers themselves,” he said. “When South Korean N.G.O.s send propaganda leaflets into North Korea using hot-air balloons—which really pisses them off—North Korea threatens to attack the N.G.O.s but instead just fires at the unmanned balloons.” In Jackson’s view, North Korea is not irrational, but it very much wants America to think that it is.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Jackson believes that the Trump Administration’s threat to launch a preventive war begins a new phase. “Trump may abandon the one thing that has prevented war in the past: U.S. restraint,” he told me. In embracing new rhetoric and rationale, the U.S. risks a spiral of hostility in which neither side intends to start a war but threats and intimidation lead to ever more aggressive behavior. Trump and Kim may goad each other into the very conflict that they are both trying to avoid.</p>\n</section><section><p>In 1966, Thomas Schelling, the deterrence expert, wrote that brinkmanship hinges, above all, on “beliefs and expectations.” Our grasp of North Korea’s beliefs and expectations is not much better than its grasp of ours. To go between Washington and Pyongyang at this nuclear moment is to be struck, most of all, by how little the two understand each other. In eighteen years of reporting, I’ve never felt as much uncertainty at the end of a project, a feeling that nobody—not the diplomats, the strategists, or the scholars who have devoted their lives to the subject—is able to describe with confidence how the other side thinks. We simply don’t know how Kim Jong Un really regards the use of his country’s nuclear arsenal, or how much North Korea’s seclusion and mythology has distorted its understanding of American resolve. We don’t know whether Kim Jong Un is taking ever-greater risks because he is determined to fulfill his family’s dream of retaking South Korea, or because he is afraid of ending up like Qaddafi.</p>\n<p>To some in the Trump Administration, the gaps in our knowledge of North Korea represent an argument against deterrence; they are unwilling to assume that Pyongyang will be constrained by the prospect of mutually assured destruction. But, if the alternative is a war with catastrophic costs, then gaps in our knowledge should make a different case. Iraq taught us the cost of going to war against an adversary that we do not fully understand. Before we take a radical step into Asia, we should be sure that we’re not making that mistake again. ♦</p>\n<p>Due to an editorial error, an earlier version of this article misidentified Kim Jong Un’s birth order.</p>\n<p><em>Reporting and photography for this piece was facilitated by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.</em></p>\n</section></div></div>"}},{"layout":"thumbnail_article","magazineStartPage":74,"article":{"id":"5a0dbfa12c4e135599ca7031","type":"article","name":"magazine/2017/11/27/the-root-of-all-cruelty","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/the-root-of-all-cruelty","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-20T10:00:00.000Z","issue_name":"November 27, 2017 Issue"},"toutImage":{"id":"5a0c93b7c5361174033709a1","description":"Illustration by Gérard DuBois","title":"171127_r30984","caption":"Violent acts are often motivated, rather than countermanded, by ethical norms.","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0c93b7c5361174033709a1/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_r30984.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0c93b7c5361174033709a1/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_r30984.jpg"},"featured@2x":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0c93b7c5361174033709a1/4:3/w_1000,c_limit/171127_r30984.jpg"}}},"ledeImage":null,"blocks":[{"type":"cartoon","id":"/cartoons/5a0df078cf6a92080ac929f7","attributes":{"id":"5a0df078cf6a92080ac929f7","title":"a21367","caption":"“Mind if I put the game on?”","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a0df078cf6a92080ac929f7/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_a21367.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a0df078cf6a92080ac929f7/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_a21367.jpg"}}}},{"type":"cartoon","id":"/cartoons/5a0df07832e52953cc4d2af4","attributes":{"id":"5a0df07832e52953cc4d2af4","title":"a20976","caption":"“We’re already wondering what her legacy might be.”","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a0df07832e52953cc4d2af4/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_a20976.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a0df07832e52953cc4d2af4/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_a20976.jpg"}}}},{"type":"image","id":"/photos/5a0c93b7c5361174033709a1","description":"Illustration by Gérard DuBois","title":"171127_r30984","caption":"Violent acts are often motivated, rather than countermanded, by ethical norms.","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0c93b7c5361174033709a1/master/w_1500,c_limit/171127_r30984.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0c93b7c5361174033709a1/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171127_r30984.jpg"}},"attributes":{}}],"title":"The Root of All Cruelty?","dek":"Perpetrators of violence, we’re told, dehumanize their victims.

It’s a standard science-fiction scenario, man against monster, but there’s a twist: it turns out that the soldier and his cohort have brain implants that make them see the faces and bodies of their targets as monstrous, to hear their pleas for mercy as noxious squeaks. When our hero’s implant fails, he discovers that he isn’t a brave defender of the human race—he’s a murderer of innocent people, part of a campaign to exterminate members of a despised group akin to the Jews of Europe in the nineteen-forties.</p>\n<p>The philosopher David Livingstone Smith, commenting on this episode on social media, wondered whether its writer had read his book “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Less-Than-Human-Enslave-Exterminate/dp/1250003830\">Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others</a>” (St. Martin’s). It’s a thoughtful and exhaustive exploration of human cruelty, and the episode perfectly captures its core idea: that acts such as genocide happen when one fails to appreciate the humanity of others.</p>\n<p>One focus of Smith’s book is the attitudes of slave owners; the seventeenth-century missionary Morgan Godwyn observed that they believed the Negroes, “though in their Figure they carry some resemblances of Manhood, yet are indeed <em>no Men</em>” but, rather, “Creatures destitute of Souls, to be ranked among Brute Beasts, and treated accordingly.” Then there’s the Holocaust. Like many Jews my age, I was raised with stories of gas chambers, gruesome medical experiments, and mass graves—an evil that was explained as arising from the Nazis’ failure to see their victims as human. In the words of the psychologist Herbert C. Kelman, “The inhibitions against murdering fellow human beings are generally so strong that the victims must be deprived of their human status if systematic killing is to proceed in a smooth and orderly fashion.” The Nazis used bureaucratic euphemisms such as “transfer” and “selection” to sanitize different forms of murder.</p>\n<p>As the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss noted, “humankind ceases at the border of the tribe, of the linguistic group, even sometimes of the village.” Today, the phenomenon seems inescapable. Google your favorite despised human group—Jews, blacks, Arabs, gays, and so on—along with words like “vermin,” “roaches,” or “animals,” and it will all come spilling out. Some of this rhetoric is seen as inappropriate for mainstream discourse. But wait long enough and you’ll hear the word “animals” used even by respectable people, referring to terrorists, or to Israelis or Palestinians, or to undocumented immigrants, or to deporters of undocumented immigrants. Such rhetoric shows up in the speech of white supremacists—but also when the rest of us talk about white supremacists.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>It’s not just a matter of words. At Auschwitz, the Nazis tattooed numbers on their prisoners’ arms. Throughout history, people have believed that it was acceptable to own humans, and there were explicit debates in which scholars and politicians mulled over whether certain groups (such as blacks and Native Americans) were “natural slaves.” Even in the past century, there were human zoos, where Africans were put in enclosures for Europeans to gawk at.</p>\n<p>Early psychological research on dehumanization looked at what made the Nazis different from the rest of us. But psychologists now talk about the ubiquity of dehumanization. Nick Haslam, at the University of Melbourne, and Steve Loughnan, at the University of Edinburgh, provide a list of examples, including some painfully mundane ones: “Outraged members of the public call sex offenders animals. Psychopaths treat victims merely as means to their vicious ends. The poor are mocked as libidinous dolts. Passersby look through homeless people as if they were transparent obstacles. Dementia sufferers are represented in the media as shuffling zombies.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0df078cf6a92080ac929f7}}--></div><p>The thesis that viewing others as objects or animals enables our very worst conduct would seem to explain a great deal. Yet there’s reason to think that it’s almost the opposite of the truth.</p>\n</section><section><p>At some European soccer games, fans make monkey noises at African players and throw bananas at them. Describing Africans as monkeys is a common racist trope, and might seem like yet another example of dehumanization. But plainly these fans don’t really think the players are monkeys; the whole point of their behavior is to disorient and humiliate. To believe that such taunts are effective is to assume that their targets would be ashamed to be thought of that way—which implies that, at some level, you think of them as people after all.</p>\n<p>Consider what happened after Hitler annexed Austria, in 1938. Timothy Snyder offers a haunting description in “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Black-Earth-Holocaust-History-Warning/dp/1101903473\">Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning</a>”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The next morning the “scrubbing parties” began. Members of the Austrian SA, working from lists, from personal knowledge, and from the knowledge of passersby, identified Jews and forced them to kneel and clean the streets with brushes. This was a ritual humiliation. Jews, often doctors and lawyers or other professionals, were suddenly on their knees performing menial labor in front of jeering crowds. Ernest P. remembered the spectacle of the “scrubbing parties” as “amusement for the Austrian population.” A journalist described “the fluffy Viennese blondes, fighting one another to get closer to the elevating spectacle of the ashen-faced Jewish surgeon on hands and knees before a half-dozen young hooligans with Swastika armlets and dog-whips.” Meanwhile, Jewish girls were sexually abused, and older Jewish men were forced to perform public physical exercise.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Jews who were forced to scrub the streets—not to mention those subjected to far worse degradations—were not thought of as lacking human emotions. Indeed, if the Jews had been thought to be indifferent to their treatment, there would have been nothing to watch here; the crowd had gathered because it wanted to see them suffer. The logic of such brutality is the logic of metaphor: to assert a likeness between two different things holds power only in the light of that difference. The sadism of treating human beings like vermin lies precisely in the recognition that they are not.</p>\n<p>What about violence more generally? Some evolutionary psychologists and economists explain assault, rape, and murder as rational actions, benefitting the perpetrator or the perpetrator’s genes. No doubt some violence—and a reputation for being willing and able to engage in violence—can serve a useful purpose, particularly in more brutal environments. On the other hand, much violent behavior can be seen as evidence of a loss of control. It’s Criminology 101 that many crimes are committed under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and that people who assault, rape, and murder show less impulse control in other aspects of their lives as well. In the heat of passion, the moral enormity of the violent action loses its purchase.</p>\n<p>But “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Virtuous-Violence-Hurting-Killing-Relationships/dp/1107458919\">Virtuous Violence: Hurting and Killing to Create, Sustain, End, and Honor Social Relationships</a>” (Cambridge), by the anthropologist Alan Fiske and the psychologist Tage Rai, argues that these standard accounts often have it backward. In many instances, violence is neither a cold-blooded solution to a problem nor a failure of inhibition; most of all, it doesn’t entail a blindness to moral considerations. On the contrary, morality is often a motivating force: “People are impelled to violence when they feel that to regulate certain social relationships, imposing suffering or death is necessary, natural, legitimate, desirable, condoned, admired, and ethically gratifying.” Obvious examples include suicide bombings, honor killings, and the torture of prisoners during war, but Fiske and Rai extend the list to gang fights and violence toward intimate partners. For Fiske and Rai, actions like these often reflect the desire to do the right thing, to exact just vengeance, or to teach someone a lesson. There’s a profound continuity between such acts and the punishments that—in the name of requital, deterrence, or discipline—the criminal-justice system lawfully imposes. Moral violence, whether reflected in legal sanctions, the killing of enemy soldiers in war, or punishing someone for an ethical transgression, is motivated by the recognition that its victim is a moral agent, someone fully human.</p>\n</section><section><p>In the fiercely argued and timely study “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Down-Girl-Misogyny-Kate-Manne/dp/0190604980\">Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny</a>” (Oxford), the philosopher Kate Manne makes a consonant argument about sexual violence. “The idea of rapists as monsters exonerates by caricature,” she writes, urging us to recognize “the <em>banality</em> of misogyny,” the disturbing possibility that “people may know full well that those they treat in brutally degrading and inhuman ways are fellow human beings, underneath a more or less thin veneer of false consciousness.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Manne is arguing against a weighty and well-established school of thought. Catharine A. MacKinnon has posed the question: “When will women be human?” Rae Langton has explored the idea of sexual solipsism, a doubt that women’s minds exist. And countless theorists talk about “objectification,” the tendency to deny women’s autonomy and subjecthood, and to scant their experiences. Like Fiske and Rai, Manne sees a larger truth in the opposite tendency. In misogyny, she argues, “often, it’s not a sense of women’s humanity that is lacking. Her humanity is precisely the problem.”</p>\n<p>Men, she proposes, have come to expect certain things from women—attention, admiration, sympathy, solace, and, of course, sex and love. Misogyny is the mind-set that polices and enforces these goals; it’s the “law enforcement branch” of the patriarchy. The most obvious example of this attitude is the punishing of “bad women,” where being bad means failing to give men what they want. But misogyny also involves rewarding women who do conform, and sympathizing with men (Manne calls this “himpathy”) who have done awful things to women.</p>\n<p>As a case study of misogyny, Manne considers strangulation—almost always performed by men on female intimate partners—which she describes as “a demonstration of authority and domination,” a form of torture that often leaves no marks. Other forms of expressive violence are very much intended to leave marks, notably “vitriolage,” or acid attacks, directed against girls and women in Bangladesh and elsewhere. Catalysts for such attacks include refusal of marriage, sex, and romance. Then, there are so-called family annihilators, almost always men, who kill their families and, typically, themselves. Often, the motivation is shame, but sometimes hatred is a factor as well; and sometimes the mother of murdered children is left alive, perhaps notified by phone or a letter afterward—<em>See what you’ve made me do.</em> The victim is also the audience; her imagined response figures large in the perpetrator’s imagination.</p>\n<p>Manne delves into the case of Elliot Rodger, who, in 2014, went on a killing spree, targeting people at random, after he was denied entry to a sorority house at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He slew six people and injured fourteen more before killing himself. In a videotape, Rodger, who was twenty-two, explained that women “gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me.” And then, talking to these women, he said, “I will punish you all for it . . . . I’ll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you.”</p>\n<p>Manne makes clear that Rodger wasn’t objectifying women; he was simply enraged that their capacity for love and romance didn’t extend to him. Manne’s analysis can be seen as an exploration of an observation made by Margaret Atwood—that men are afraid that women will laugh at them, and women are afraid that men will kill them. For Manne, such violent episodes are merely an extreme manifestation of everyday misogyny, and she extends her analysis to catcalling, attitudes toward abortion, and the predations of Donald Trump.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a0df07832e52953cc4d2af4}}--></div><p>Nor are the mechanisms she identifies confined to misogyny. The aggressions licensed by moral entitlement, the veneer of bad faith: those things are evident in a wide range of phenomena, from slaveholders’ religion-tinctured justifications to the Nazi bureaucrats’ squeamishness about naming the activity they were organizing, neither of which would have been necessary if the oppressors were really convinced that their victims were beasts.</p>\n<p>If the worst acts of cruelty aren’t propelled by dehumanization, not all dehumanization is accompanied by cruelty. Manne points out that there’s nothing wrong with a surgeon viewing her patients as mere bodies when they’re on the operating table; in fact, it’s important for doctors not to have certain natural reactions—anger, moral disgust, sexual desire—when examining patients. The philosopher Martha C. Nussbaum has given the example of using your sleeping partner’s stomach as a pillow when lying in bed, and goes on to explore the more fraught case of objectification during sexual intercourse, suggesting that there’s nothing inherently wrong about this so long as it is consensual and restricted to the bedroom.</p>\n<p>As a philosopher, Manne grounds her arguments in more technical literature, and at one point she emphasizes the connection between her position and the Oxford philosopher P. F. Strawson’s theory of “reactive attitudes.” Strawson argued that, when we’re dealing with another person as a person, we can’t help experiencing such attitudes as admiration and gratitude, resentment and blame. You generally don’t feel this way toward rocks or rodents. Acknowledging the humanity of another, then, has its risks, and these are neatly summarized by Manne, who notes that seeing someone as a person makes it possible for that person to be a true friend or beloved spouse, but it also makes it possible for people to be “an intelligible <em>rival, enemy, usurper, insubordinate, betrayer</em>, etc.” She goes on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, in being capable of rationality, agency, autonomy, and judgment, they are also someone who could coerce, manipulate, humiliate, or shame you. In being capable of abstract relational thought and congruent moral emotions, they are capable of thinking ill of you and regarding you contemptuously. In being capable of forming complex desires and intentions, they are capable of harboring malice and plotting against you. In being capable of valuing, they may value what you abhor and abhor what you value. They may hence be a threat to all that you cherish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If there’s something missing from these approaches to violence, it’s attention to first-person attitudes, how we think about <em>ourselves</em> as moral agents. I can resent someone, but I can also feel shame at how I treated him or her. Fiske and Rai sometimes write as if the paradigm of moralistic violence were the final scene of the movie in which our hero blows away the terrorist or the serial killer or the rapist—a deeply satisfying act that has everyone cheering. But what about doubt and ambivalence? Some fathers who severely beat their misbehaving children, or some soldiers who engage in “punitive rape,” are confident in the moral rightness of their acts. But some aren’t. Real moral progress may involve studying the forms of doubt and ambivalence that sometimes attend acts of brutality.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>In a masterly and grim book, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Long-Night-History-Concentration/dp/0316303593\">One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps</a>” (Little, Brown), Andrea Pitzer articulates some of the perplexities of her subject. A concentration camp exists, she says, whenever a government holds groups of civilians outside the normal legal process, and nearly all nations have had them. They can be the most savage places on earth, but this isn’t an essential feature. During the Second World War, American camps for the Japanese weren’t nearly as terrible as camps in Germany and the Soviet Union. There are even some camps that began with noble intentions, such as refugee camps set up to provide food and shelter—though they tend to worsen over time, evolving into what Pitzer describes as “permanent purgatory.”</p>\n<p>When concentration camps are established, they are usually said to exist to protect the larger population from some suspect group, or to be part of a civilizing message, or to be a way to restrain some group of civilians from supporting hostile forces. From this perspective, concentration camps are a means to an end, an example of instrumental violence. Typically, though, the camps do have a punitive aspect. Pitzer tells of how, after the First World War, Bavaria’s Social Democratic premier, Kurt Eisner, was slow to demand that Germans be released from French and British camps; he wished instead to appeal to the Allies’ sense of humanity. Eisner was Jewish, and Hitler fumed about this “betrayal” in a speech in 1922, saying that the Jews should learn “how it feels to live in concentration camps!”</p>\n<p>Certainly, Pitzer’s description of various concentration camps contains so many examples of cruelty and degradation that it’s impossible to see them as a mere failure to acknowledge the humanity of their victims. As the scholar of warfare Johannes Lang has observed of the Nazi death camps, “What might look like the dehumanization of the other is instead a way to exert power over another human.”</p>\n<p>The limitations of the dehumanization thesis are hardly good news. There has always been something optimistic about the idea that our worst acts of inhumanity are based on confusion. It suggests that we could make the world better simply by having a clearer grasp of reality—by deactivating those brain implants, or their ideological equivalent. The truth may be harder to accept: that our best and our worst tendencies arise precisely from seeing others as human. ♦</p>\n</section></div></div>"}},{"layout":"thumbnail_article","magazineStartPage":38,"article":{"id":"5a01e40ae725e60e02ce3614","type":"article","name":"magazine/2017/11/20/how-to-get-rich-playing-video-games-online","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/how-to-get-rich-playing-video-games-online","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-13T10:00:00.000Z","issue_name":"November 20, 2017 Issue"},"toutImage":{"id":"5a049c56f40de92b738136a3","description":"Illustration by Andy Rementer","title":"171120_r30940_rd","caption":"The most followed players on the platform Twitch earn well into seven figures.","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a049c56f40de92b738136a3/master/w_1500,c_limit/171120_r30940_rd.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a049c56f40de92b738136a3/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171120_r30940_rd.jpg"},"featured@2x":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a049c56f40de92b738136a3/4:3/w_1000,c_limit/171120_r30940_rd.jpg"}}},"ledeImage":null,"blocks":[{"type":"cartoon","id":"/cartoons/5a04d6ef0dca400c4bcf0e00","attributes":{"id":"5a04d6ef0dca400c4bcf0e00","title":"a21386","caption":"“I keep telling you, poppy-seed bagels are nothing but trouble.”","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a04d6ef0dca400c4bcf0e00/master/w_1500,c_limit/171120_a21386.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5a04d6ef0dca400c4bcf0e00/4:3/w_500,c_limit/171120_a21386.jpg"}}}},{"type":"cartoon","id":"/cartoons/5a04d6ef8c4c543db096301c","attributes":{"id":"5a04d6ef8c4c543db096301c","title":"a20894","caption":"“Hey, guys!

Dariani is the founder and C.E.O. of Online Performers Group, a talent-management company dedicated to professional video-game streamers, who broadcast their game play and commentary live over the Internet. He is thirty-eight, with a dry, ironic wit and a nervous habit of twirling his goatee, which is rapidly going gray; his clients are, for the most part, young, boisterous, and unpredictable. That day, he was on his way to meet the streamer Roberto Garcia, who was supposed to be at home but had instead gone to a casino outside the city to celebrate his girlfriend’s birthday. Dariani’s speedometer crept toward ninety miles per hour. “We just need to get there before he starts to drink,” he said.</p>\n<p>Garcia, known online as Towelliee, is a star broadcaster on Twitch, a streaming platform whose popularity has turned recreational gaming into an improbably viable career. Each month, a hundred million visitors watch their favorite personalities play video games on Twitch, spending an average of nearly two hours a day there. This audience is large enough to make the site one of the twenty most trafficked in the U.S., yet it’s perhaps more apt to measure Twitch against a different medium. With viewership numbers that rival those of MSNBC or CNN, Twitch is less like a conventional Web site than like a kaleidoscopic television network: thousands of channels at once, broadcasting live at every hour of the day.</p>\n<p>Shortly before noon, Dariani pulled up in front of the Viejas Casino &amp; Resort and handed his keys to a valet. He strode inside, eyes scanning the acres of slot machines. Though Dariani is chummy and non-judgmental with clients, he’s seen enough drunk streamers fall off balconies at industry parties to inspire an almost parental anxiety. He glanced at his phone, and then showed me an eclectically punctuated text from Garcia. “That’s probably not a good sign of sobriety,” he said. Yet when Garcia appeared—bearded, stout, and wearing aviator sunglasses—he was convivial but composed. “I just watched my girlfriend lose nine hundred dollars in about three minutes,” he announced cheerfully.</p>\n<p>Garcia led us up to the casino’s Presidential Suite, where his girlfriend, Aracely, was waiting at the bar. When Garcia started streaming, in 2010, he’d recently been laid off from a quality-assurance job at a pharmaceutical-software company; he and Aracely scraped by on unemployment checks and her wages from Costco. Game broadcasting was new, and the business model all but nonexistent. Still, Garcia thought that he could make it work, so he sat Aracely down to convince her. “Imagine telling your girlfriend, ‘I’m going to stop looking for a job and play video games for a living,’ ” he told me. Aracely, sitting beside him, nodded. “It was a hard conversation,” she said.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Game streaming, Garcia discovered, required non-stop work. The only way to attract viewers, and to prevent the ones you had from straying to other broadcasters, was to be online constantly, so he routinely streamed for eighteen hours a day. “That’s what I had to do to grow the viewership,” he said. His ankles swelled from sitting at his computer. His weight grew to four hundred and twenty pounds.</p>\n<p>Garcia’s specialty is the multiplayer fantasy game World of Warcraft. While he isn’t its best player, he has a knack for talking entertainingly over his play: he is funny, brash, and filled with stories about his delinquent childhood in Newark. (“I was so bad, I got kicked out of the <em class=\"small\">dare</em> program,” he told me.) After a year of broadcasting, he had a steady audience of seven hundred, but he was still desperately broke. During a stream, he asked viewers to help him hang on a little longer. One sent him fifteen hundred dollars—a gift that reduced Garcia to tears. “I had to shut my mike off and walk away,” he said. “Everyone was, like, ‘Where’d he go? Is he dead from the donation?’ ”</p>\n<p>Six years later, Garcia makes several times that amount on a good day. Since 2011, he has been one of Twitch’s “partners,” an élite group that includes some twenty-five thousand streamers, of the 2.2 million active on the site. Between his thousands of subscribers—who pay a monthly fee for access to perks such as ad-free viewing—and his sponsorships, appearance fees, and tips, he earns a “low- to mid-six-figure” income. His streaming schedule has become more manageable, though it remains arduous: sixty hours a week, no days off except occasional Saturdays. He has devoted nearly thirty thousand hours to World of Warcraft. “I’m a grinder, man,” he told me.</p>\n<p>To sponsors, Twitch offers a novel opportunity: access to a generation that resists traditional advertising media but is steeped in video games. Young people watch game streaming in huge numbers (Twitch claims to reach half of the millennial males in the United States) and often in prodigious quantities. “This year, Towelliee’s viewers have watched five hundred and ninety-four <em>years</em> of his content,” Dariani said. In 2016, Garcia sold nearly three million dollars’ worth of his sponsors’ products through links on his Twitch channel.</p>\n<p>For all the traffic and revenue that Twitch generates, the game-streaming market remains a free-for-all, its driven, rambunctious broadcasters struggling to manage their newfound success. Dariani aims to become streaming’s William Morris—a pioneering talent manager who leads a new class of entertainer into professionalism. Already, his best-paid clients can earn two million dollars a year; some command twenty thousand dollars to play a studio’s game for a single three-hour stream. Executives both covet and fear Twitch broadcasters’ influence. “This eighteen-year-old punk kid shows up,” Dariani told me, describing a typical meeting with potential sponsors, “and he’s talking about how things are ‘retarded’ and making fart jokes and not listening to your team with a hundred years of experience. And you’re sitting there going, ‘This is the guy who makes the decision about whether my company succeeds or fails?’ ” Dariani smiled. “First you’re angry. But then you’re terrified.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n</section><section><p>Online Performers Group’s office sits on the top floor of a putty-gray building in San Diego’s Point Loma neighborhood, less than a mile from the airport; the roar of plane traffic frequently interrupts conversation. “We call it the Point Loma pause,” Dariani said. “It gives you time to reflect.” One recent afternoon, Oliver Pascual, an account manager, stood at his desk watching a client’s stream of a game called Farming Simulator 17. Onscreen, a grimy blue tractor hauled a trailer through an autumnal pasture. “People like watching him farm stuff,” Pascual explained, shrugging. “He’s literally looking for a place to dump grass right now.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a04d6ef0dca400c4bcf0e00}}--></div><p>Nearby, a whiteboard listed dozens of pending deals, including projects with Intel and Logitech. On the opposite wall, a huge television showed a client called ProfessorBroman broadcasting the sci-fi blockbuster Destiny 2 for an audience of six thousand. (A few days later, another client, KingGothalion, would play Destiny 2 in a marathon stream that attracted more than half a million viewers.) Meanwhile, on a love seat in the waiting area, the streamer Cinthya Alicea, who broadcasts as CinCinBear, toyed idly with her blue hair extensions as she chatted with employees about an upcoming cruise to Mexico to which O.P.G. was treating its clients and staff.</p>\n<p>Outside a doorway warning “<em class=\"small\">KEEP OUT</em>: Omeed’s Private Volcano Lair,” Dariani stood in his typical outfit of T-shirt, jeans, and sandals. His wife, Jennifer, a Harvard history-of-science Ph.D. who is O.P.G.’s chief operating officer, emerged from the adjacent office with news that another streamer had just signed—the tenth in the past week, nearly doubling their client count, to twenty-four. The two paused a moment, mulling the extra work that this would entail. “That’s great,” Dariani said, uncertainly.</p>\n<p>Dariani’s usual demeanor is one of skeptical diligence. The son of an Iranian father and an Oklahoman mother, he dropped out of the University of Virginia in 2000 and spent years working for the companies that make the card games Magic: The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh!. In 2012, he joined Sony Online Entertainment as a global brand manager. On his first day there, he recalled, the president of his division spoke with the marketing team: “He starts yelling at us, ‘If you marketing fuckers don’t figure out this Twitch thing, we’re going to get buried!’ ”</p>\n<p>But Twitch resisted easy figuring out. The service began less as a commercial venture than as a piece of performance art. In 2007, a group of recent Yale graduates concocted the idea of broadcasting every moment of the co-founder Justin Kan’s life, through a Web site that they called Justin.tv. For nine months, from a camera attached to his hat, Kan beamed out live video of everything he did (except for bodily necessities), using a streaming tool that the group had developed. The stunt eventually wore thin, but viewers kept asking for a way to live-stream their own exploits. To the founders’ surprise, what users wanted most was to broadcast themselves playing video games. “It became the tail that wagged the dog,” Emmett Shear, a co-founder and Twitch’s current C.E.O., later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/technology/speed-and-spectators-lead-to-a-gaming-nexus.html?_r=0\">told</a> the <em>Times</em>. “It ended up taking over our whole company.” In 2014, Amazon acquired the service, which had been renamed Twitch, for nine hundred and seventy million dollars. It now has more than twelve hundred employees.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Generally speaking, a Twitch stream is not riveting entertainment—or even, to the uninitiated, all that comprehensible. Click on a channel, and what you will encounter is routine game play, along with two other frames: a miniature box showing the face of the streamer, who provides occasional commentary; and, to the right, a chat window that scrolls with the indecipherable speed of a spinning game-show wheel. The streamer, seated before his computer, might grow animated as he reacts to the game, but just as often he is fixated and still, his expressionless face blue-lit by monitor glow. Even Dariani struggled at first to make sense of the site. “I started watching a lot of streams,” he recalled, “and it was, like, Guy with a beard, another guy with a beard, another guy with a beard. They’re all heads in boxes playing the same game.”</p>\n<p>The central mystery of Twitch, at least to newcomers, is why anyone would choose to watch such a thing, when he could play the game instead. Twitch’s spokesman, who goes only by Chase, argued, “That’s like saying to a chef, ‘Why are you watching the Food Network? Shouldn’t you be in the kitchen, cooking?’ Or to an athlete, ‘Why are you watching ESPN? Shouldn’t you be out shooting hoops?’ No. People enjoy watching others who are good at what they do.”</p>\n<p>The deeper draw to Twitch, however, is its capacity for interactivity. It was this function that intrigued Dariani. When he gave presentations on Twitch to Sony executives, he often displayed a stream behind him—and then, after a while, sent a chat message to the broadcaster, who returned his greeting on camera: “Hey, Omeed!” This invariably made the executives sit up. “All of a sudden, you see the power of the medium,” Dariani said. “Imagine you watch a television show and the show literally talks back to you, customized to what you want to hear.”</p>\n<p>Dariani e-mailed dozens of broadcasters, asking what they would charge to play Sony’s games on their streams. “They were completely random numbers,” he recalled. “The smallest guy wanted twenty-five thousand dollars. The biggest guy said, ‘I’ll do it for free—just send me a copy.’ I was, like, ‘There’s no plan here.’ ” In order to make contacts, Dariani set up shop in dive bars near gaming conventions and invited broadcasters to talk over free food and drinks. What they all told him, he remembers, was, “We don’t know what we’re doing, we don’t know anybody, and we’re terrified.” In 2014, Dariani left Sony and began representing a few streamers part time.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of last year, Dariani had one employee, and worked from his dining-room table. The company now has a staff of thirteen, along with an array of analytics tools. Its software can tell clients what hours are best for them to stream (Twitch’s viewership peaks before noon, when the North American and European crowds intersect), what their audiences’ viewing habits are, and what their sponsorship time is worth (1.1 cents per viewer per minute). One morning, Jennifer Dariani showed me a widget that they’d created which ranks, in live time, the best games for clients to play in order to maximize viewers.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>O.P.G. earns its commission from clients’ sponsorships. A healthy Twitch channel, Dariani says, should make about half its revenue from subscriptions and tips and the other half from promotional work. In recent months, this pool of sponsorship money has deepened considerably, as companies, from game studios to energy-drink brands and fast-food chains, rush to purchase streamers’ influence. When I visited O.P.G., a studio had just signed a deal for two hundred thousand dollars a month. In the car one evening, Dariani fumed that a company had asked to fly a client to Japan for an event, offering a four-thousand-dollar fee for a week’s work. “No,” Dariani had replied. “That’s the rate he gets per <em>day</em>.”</p>\n<p>In the next few years, Dariani expects, the annual marketing expenditure on Twitch streamers will surpass a billion dollars. By his rough estimate, two thousand broadcasters are already making a middle-class income through Twitch; he has seen clients turn down fifty thousand dollars for a two-hour convention appearance because they didn’t want to deal with the travel. “The amount of money in content creation is ludicrous,” David Martinez, an acquaintance of Dariani’s who manages the streamer and YouTuber Ryan “Northernlion” Letourneau, told me. “It’s one thing to make a living playing video games. It’s another thing to be people like us who make a living <em>off</em> those people, and live comfortably. It’s fucking crazy.”</p>\n</section><section><p>This August, I accompanied Dariani on a visit to his client Anthony Kongphan—whom he described, with some managerial embellishment, as “the hottest commodity on Twitch right now.” (Despite placing only two hundred and seventieth in the site’s rankings, Kongphan was gaining several thousand followers a day.) On a hilltop northeast of Portland, Oregon, Kongphan showed us into a modern exurban house that he shares with two other broadcasters. Inside, a thick layer of dust coated what little furniture was in evidence: two tables pushed awkwardly against a wall. A dining area had been converted into a makeshift bedroom, illuminated by a set of shoebox-size photography lights on telescoping stands. Mail and packages lay in unopened piles. Dariani nodded. “This is a pretty typical streamer house,” he said.</p>\n<p>Kongphan, who is thirty-two, stands out amid Twitch’s largely sallow, nondescript streamer base. Lithe and tattooed, with an impeccably spiked crest of black hair, he is a former model and actor who once had a part on “The Young and the Restless.” After struggling to break through in Hollywood, Kongphan saw a friend streaming and decided to try it. He spent years building an audience, delivering pizzas on the side. “I will never do it again, but I streamed once for sixty-three and a half hours straight,” Kongphan told me. Now he broadcasts every day from early evening to around 4 <em class=\"small\">a</em>.<em class=\"small\">m.</em> “I just wake up, eat, work out, and then stream,” he said. Recently, he’d hired his older sister to work as his assistant, doubling the salary she made at an insurance company.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>In the living room, Dariani spotted a box of samples from the St. Louis coffee company Madrinas, which had been courting Kongphan. Dariani looked vexed; he’d forwarded the package months before. “Always love seeing the stuff you sent them that they didn’t even open,” he said. He unsealed the box and extended a can of cold-brew coffee to Kongphan. “Dude, try it. They want to pay you so much money. If you don’t like it, we won’t do it.” Kongphan, who doesn’t drink coffee, eyed it warily before taking a sip. “That’s not bad, actually,” he said. “It works really well with late-night streaming,” Dariani replied.</p>\n<p>Can in hand, Kongphan led us up to his studio. At the top of the stairs, an enormous translucent purple dildo sat mounted on the wall like a floppy trophy head. “Oh,” Kongphan said, registering it. “Yeah. Don’t mind that.” Unlike the rest of the house, Kongphan’s studio was almost obsessively tidy. On his desk, a container of Clorox wipes rested beside a copy of “Heated Beat,” an erotic novel, discovered by his then-girlfriend, that features a stock photo of Kongphan on the cover. (Kongphan’s former girlfriend is also a streamer, a common situation; non-streamer partners often won’t tolerate the job’s demanding hours.) Thick black curtains blocked the evening light.</p>\n<p>Kongphan sat down in front of an array of four computer monitors and clicked a button to alert his followers that he was about to start streaming. Fans surged in, filling the chat window with emotes—small, emoji-like images that are Twitch’s preferred mode of expression. (Kongphan’s emotes, available only to his subscribers, are largely ninja-themed, matching his channel’s graphics.) Kongphan put on a gaming headset and leaned in to the microphone above his keyboard. The moment the video feed kicked in, his demeanor brightened. “Hello, hello, everyone!” he called out, grinning. “What up? Twitch is alive!” For ten minutes, he mostly greeted viewers, calling them out by name: “RevTomato! Muntface! Nick! Razer!”</p>\n<p>Like all of Dariani’s clients, Kongphan is a “variety streamer.” While some broadcasters focus exclusively on one game (and consequently lose viewers if that game’s popularity declines), variety streamers switch titles freely, succeeding on the strength of their charisma. “Their audiences aren’t just there to watch them play League of Legends,” Dariani said. “They’re there because they like that person.” This congeniality makes variety streamers much more appealing to sponsors. Whereas some high-level gamers grow too focussed on matches to speak, streamers like Kongphan are as garrulous as morning-radio hosts, able to talk enthusiastically—and to boost products—for hours. Kongphan’s audience is so loyal and adoring (some fans have tipped him more than ten thousand dollars over time, or watched him stream for twenty-four hours straight) that his channel can resemble a benign personality cult, built around a carefully honed version of himself: engaged, jokey, ceaselessly positive.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>It helps, of course, that Kongphan is also a highly skilled gamer, his reflexes sharpened by thousands of hours of practice and enhanced by a diet of his own devising. (It involves a lot of chicken breast.) In his studio, he started up PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, a game that Twitch helped propel to success. In Battlegrounds, matches begin with a hundred players, who scrounge weapons and supplies from a constantly shrinking map; the last player left alive wins. Kongphan is almost always that player—even though he is only half paying attention. As he played, fingers clacking across the keyboard, his eyes flicked periodically from the screen to his chat monitor, so that he could keep up a steady patter with his audience. “Would you rather have spatulas for hands or have to fight 10 midgets on PCP?” one viewer asked. Kongphan, still shooting enemies, presided over the ensuing debate.</p>\n<p>The broadcaster BurkeBlack told me, “Streaming on Twitch is a game of its own”—a puzzle that requires specialized skills and strategies. The lifeblood of a Twitch channel is its “subs”: broadcasters get a share of every five-dollar monthly subscription. According to streamers I spoke with, that share ranges from fifty to seventy per cent, depending on their popularity. For every Twitch star earning seven figures, there are thousands struggling to figure out how to lure enough subscribers to survive. Do they need a gimmick? Should they play different games? Interact more with chat? “There’s no right answer,” Daniel “iKasperr” Bong, a longtime streamer, told me. “The audience gets to choose what they want to watch, and it’s almost like putting our fate in their hands. It’s scary.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best embodiment of the effort to master Twitch is Ben Cassell, O.P.G.’s first client, who broadcasts, as CohhCarnage, from his farmhouse in North Carolina. After nearly quitting Twitch in 2013, when sixteen-hour streams weren’t winning him an audience, Cassell instead dedicated himself to research. “This medium is brand new,” he explained. “There’s nowhere to go to see how to succeed on Twitch.” So he built data-tracking software, and studied scheduling, game selection, and the market’s niches: hard-core professional gamers, lighthearted jesters, “boobie streamers,” histrionic yellers, baseball-cap-wearing frat bros. Based on his findings, Cassell reinvented his channel as upbeat and safe-for-work; to followers, he told me, “my channel is ‘Cheers.’ ” Every day—and he has logged more than fourteen hundred in a row, including the one on which his first child was born—he begins his stream at 8 <em class=\"small\">A</em>.<em class=\"small\">M</em>., right before Twitch’s audience crests.</p>\n<p>Cassell now has four full-time employees, along with a squad of contractors: artists, coders, sound technicians. The graphics on his channel, from the splashy title sequence to the customized overlays for each game, wouldn’t be out of place on cable television. Paid moderators scrub any toxicity from his chat window. While he streams, he monitors a variety of applications so that every decision is optimized. “Twitch is not ‘If you build it, they will come,’ ” he said. “It’s like surfing, where you have to go to the waves.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<div class=\"callout\"><!--{{/cartoon/5a04d6ef8c4c543db096301c}}--></div></section><section><p>In the early morning of February 19th, the Virginia broadcaster Brian Vigneault stepped away from his Twitch stream, telling his viewers that he was taking a cigarette break. At the time, Vigneault, a thirty-five-year-old father of three, had been live for twenty-two hours of a charity stream that was planned to last a full day. The broadcast never resumed; later, Vigneault’s body was found in his Virginia Beach home. Many of his peers speculated that he had suffered a heart attack from too many marathon streams. Months later, it emerged that he’d died of an overdose of the opioid fentanyl. Yet the speculation had not been implausible; several broadcasters, including one of Dariani’s clients, have suffered heart attacks while streaming. “What we do is not healthy,” BurkeBlack told me.</p>\n<p>At this summer’s <em class=\"small\">pax</em> West—a yearly convention that inundates downtown Seattle with gaming fans—virtually every streamer I spoke with voiced concerns about the health risks of overwork. “My doctor told me I was going to die if I kept doing it like this,” a young broadcaster who goes by Bria Leigh said. “You spend ten hours a day in the chair. And you don’t even want to get up to use the bathroom, because you’re afraid you’ll lose viewers.”</p>\n<p>On the convention floor, thousands of gamers, many in costume as bionic angels and blue-skinned assassins, waited in line to play demos and to pose with any of a half-dozen colossal sculpted dragons, which developers had brought to promote games. Outside Twitch’s area, Sonja Reid, a Canadian streamer known as OMGitsfirefoxx, signed game consoles for fans and posed for selfies in yellow-tinted sunglasses. Reid is the most popular female broadcaster on Twitch, with close to a million followers. (This places her sixty-sixth in the site’s rankings; Twitch’s broadcasters, like its viewers, are overwhelmingly male.) But later, away from her fans, she told me that she was stepping back from Twitch. “I got burned out,” she said. “I wasn’t doing anything else with my life. I wasn’t going outside. I was spending all my time on the Internet.”</p>\n<p>Reid also had to contend with a gaming culture that can be shockingly hostile to women. Like Bria Leigh, she had been stalked by viewers. She’d been “doxxed,” her personal information revealed online. Many female broadcasters cope with sexual solicitation and other forms of harassment. The streamer Cinthya Alicea matter-of-factly told me what it was like to be “swatted”—a vicious prank in which trolls anonymously report a made-up threat to police, summoning a <em class=\"small\">SWAT</em> team to a target’s home. As Alicea streamed, officers stormed into her house and put her in handcuffs. “I’m just thankful they didn’t shoot my dog,” she said.</p>\n<p>For Dariani, protecting his charges is a constant concern. Several times, I saw him and his wife implore clients to let them take work off their hands. Need prizes shipped to viewers? “We can do gift fulfillment for you.” Forgot to bring toiletries to the conference? Here’s a kit with toothpaste, Purell, and multivitamins. When Kongphan mentioned wanting to move to Austin, Texas, Dariani volunteered to find him a house. “These streamers don’t have anybody in their corner,” Dariani told me. “We need to be that person.” The Darianis own a rental condo on the beach in San Diego, and they offer it for free to clients who need time away. No one has ever accepted. “They just don’t take vacations,” Jennifer Dariani said. To help break this trend, O.P.G. recently devised a plan to pay clients to take up to ten days off a year.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Streamers accept the difficult conditions because they know that success requires them to allow fans constant access: for viewers, a Twitch channel is not just entertainment but also a virtual community, which functions only when its most important member is online. Gaming began, decades ago, as a social experience, in arcades and on living-room sofas. But as games have become more lushly immersive and complex—often designed to reward thousands of hours of play—they have in many ways become more isolating, encouraging solitude and, for some gamers, loneliness. Twitch has succeeded because it made gaming feel communal again. As Chase, Twitch’s spokesman, told me, “We’re essentially a social network for the gaming age.”</p>\n<p>Garcia and Cassell both like to compare their channels to a neighborhood pub. Streamers become favorite bartenders, charming and constantly available. Viewers, swapping messages in chat, become fellow-regulars. There might be the occasional bar fight—Twitch can be as noxious as anywhere else on the Internet—but the tone is typically convivial. Viewers generate inside jokes, ask for life advice, even discuss their experiences of grief or depression. (They also pair off, as two of Cassell’s moderators did.) “There are two ways to look at Twitch,” Cassell told me. “One is that it’s people playing video games and other people watching, which is what ninety-nine per cent of the world sees. But the other side of Twitch is that you are playing a game with someone on the couch. There’s a level of interaction that’s just not there in standard media.”</p>\n<p>This interaction has an unusual kind of immediacy: participate enough in Cassell’s Twitch channel, and he’ll greet you by name, every day. “If you asked a hundred viewers why they watch their favorite streamer, what they’re all going to tell you is, ‘I feel like I could be their friend,’ ” Cecilia D’Anastasio, who covers Twitch for the gaming site Kotaku, said. Michael Blight, a DePaul University communications professor whose research has explored viewers’ bonds with Twitch streamers, told me that these largely one-sided “parasocial relationships” grow deeply meaningful. “People were almost sheepish about revealing this, but they’d say, ‘I know I’m just one of his thousands of fans, but I really do feel like he understands me,’ ” Blight said. “They come to feel like this person is a part of them.”</p>\n</section><section><p>Late one afternoon in the <em class=\"small\">pax</em> West exhibition hall, Kongphan, in a slim-cut white Oxford shirt, stood at a Twitch lectern, signing autographs alongside three other streamers. The line, a hundred deep, kept stalling as admirers reached him. Some fans were preteens, chaperoned by parents. Others displayed their own Twitch handles on nametags. As the event wore on, one of Kongphan’s chat moderators, who goes by MrMcStabby, introduced himself to me. Kongphan’s channel, he said, was his “big, weird family,” a balm after shifts at his day job, as a security guard. “It’s a bunch of bloodthirsty maniacs, but very supportive,” he said. “Maniacs that care.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>While we spoke, a party of eight young Asian men in e-sports attire reached the head of the line and swarmed Kongphan. Each, in turn, handed him a convention badge to sign, the entire group cheering every pen stroke. When Kongphan, posing for a selfie, hugged one fan suggestively from behind, a cry went up: “I’m jealous! I’m jealous!” As the other streamers looked on, bemused, MrMcStabby leaned in to me. “You see?” he said, smiling. “Maniacs.”</p>\n<p>That evening, at a party for streamers in an Irish pub, I found Dariani, looking especially careworn. In the past twenty-four hours, he had closed five sponsorship deals. Across the bar, he spotted a brunette so diminutive that the crowd seemed periodically to swallow her. “That’s HaleyBaby, another new client,” he told me. “She does streaming and Lolita modelling.” “Lolita?” I asked. “In Japan, it doesn’t mean the same thing it does here,” he hastily explained. “Well, it <em>does</em>, but it’s less sexual.”</p>\n<p>Dariani made the rounds of streamers, many of whom brightened at his approach. Every day, he’s petitioned by broadcasters who hope that O.P.G. will represent them, but he plans to expand the company at a sensible pace. “A year from now, I’ll bet we could manage a hundred clients,” he told me. Already, he has received investment and acquisition offers, which he has turned down. “I love these people and love what I do,” Dariani said. “When I see a guy who a couple years ago was functionally homeless and now is able to have a family and buy a house, how can you burn out on that?”</p>\n<p>On the sidewalk outside, dozens of streamers in purple Twitch T-shirts stood vaping and talking, in the effervescent manner of people expecting good things. Among them was Zachary Whitten, the Twitch liaison for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital; in large part through O.P.G. broadcasters like Kongphan and ProfessorBroman, St. Jude has raised more than six million dollars on the site. “What Omeed’s doing is forcing the modernization of this industry,” Whitten told me. He gestured out at the crowd. “Because a lot of these kids don’t recognize their value, right? Omeed is showing these streamers exactly what they’re worth.” ♦</p>\n</section></div></div>"}},{"layout":"thumbnail_article","article":{"id":"5a0a02f2a37d62489e1940ea","type":"post","name":"news/news-desk/locals-were-troubled-by-roy-moores-interactions-with-teen-girls-at-the-gadsden-mall","metered":true,"link":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/locals-were-troubled-by-roy-moores-interactions-with-teen-girls-at-the-gadsden-mall","appExclude":false,"date":{"pubDate":"2017-11-13T23:22:16.338Z","issue_name":null},"toutImage":{"id":"5a0876e78a18b874bfa634c6","description":"Photograph by Mark Peterson / Redux","title":"Bethea_Roy-Moore","caption":"Rumors have swirled for years that, in the early eighties, the Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore was banned from a shopping mall for bothering teen-age girls.","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0876e78a18b874bfa634c6/master/w_1500,c_limit/Bethea_Roy-Moore.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0876e78a18b874bfa634c6/4:3/w_500,c_limit/Bethea_Roy-Moore.jpg"},"featured@2x":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0876e78a18b874bfa634c6/4:3/w_1000,c_limit/Bethea_Roy-Moore.jpg"}}},"ledeImage":{"id":"5a0876e78a18b874bfa634c6","description":"Photograph by Mark Peterson / Redux","title":"Bethea_Roy-Moore","caption":"Rumors have swirled for years that, in the early eighties, the Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore was banned from a shopping mall for bothering teen-age girls.","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0876e78a18b874bfa634c6/master/w_1500,c_limit/Bethea_Roy-Moore.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0876e78a18b874bfa634c6/4:3/w_500,c_limit/Bethea_Roy-Moore.jpg"}}},"blocks":[{"type":"image","id":"/photos/5a0a26af40284b1dd15fec9f","description":"Photograph by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / AFP / Getty","title":"Bethea_Roy-Moore-secondary","caption":"","sizes":{"master":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0a26af40284b1dd15fec9f/master/w_1500,c_limit/Bethea_Roy-Moore-secondary.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a0a26af40284b1dd15fec9f/4:3/w_500,c_limit/Bethea_Roy-Moore-secondary.jpg"}},"attributes":{}}],"title":"Locals Were Troubled by Roy Moore’s Interactions with Teen Girls at the Gadsden Mall","dek":"","description":"Rumors have swirled for years that, in the early eighties, Roy Moore was banned from a mall for bothering teen-age girls.","rubric":"News Desk","author":[{"id":"5910a8b1dd6207318b5db98d","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Charles Bethea is a contributing writer for newyorker.com, and has written for *The New Yorker* since 2008.

I saw it as I\ndrove around, crisscrossing George Wallace Drive. I also saw Trump\nposters, Confederate flags, and dozens of signs for Doug Jones, the\nDemocrat <a href=\"http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/11/allegations_against_roy_moore.html#incart_most-read_\">tied with Moore in recent Senate-race\npolls</a>.\nGadsden is the seat of Etowah County, which is a conservative place;\n<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> received three times as many votes in the county as Hillary\nClinton did. (Statewide, he received twice as many.) But I didn’t, in\nall my driving, see a single yard sign for Moore, the home-town son.\nEven the parking lot of the one mall in town had more bumper stickers\nfor Luther Strange (four), Moore’s opponent in the Republican primary, than for Moore himself (one).</p>\n<p>The Gadsden Mall opened in 1974. It has two department stores, Belk and\nSears, one on each end. Between them, on Sunday night, I walked past\nBooks-A-Million, Cellular Solutions, a Japanese steak house, Great\nAmerican Cookies, Blacklight Mini-Golf, KnockerBall Gadsden, an\neyebrow-styling kiosk, and a clothing store for young girls, called\nJustice. A diverse assortment of families wandered around the place,\nwhich felt trapped in time. Two young security guards made their rounds.\n“It gets rough in here on Saturday nights,” one of them told me,\nmentioning fighting, stealing, and gun-toting. “We still have an active\nban list,” the other said, referencing a list of chronic\nrule-breakers not allowed on mall property. “But it doesn’t go back that\nfar.”</p>\n<p>He meant back to the early eighties, when Roy Moore was, many people\nsay, a regular visitor to the mall. On Thursday, the Washington <em>Post</em> reported that, when Moore was a thirty-two-year-old assistant district\nattorney in Etowah County, he brought Leigh Corfman, who was fourteen\nyears old at the time, to his home and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.7c26d02b7099\">sexually molested\nher</a>.\nThree additional women told the <em>Post</em> that Moore had pursued them when\nthey were in their teens and he was in his early thirties.\n(On Monday, another woman, Beverly Young Nelson, said that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/roy-moore-alabama-senate.html\">Moore\nassaulted\nher</a> when she was sixteen years old. At a press conference, she held up a high-school yearbook that she said Moore signed before the alleged assault.) Two of the women say that they first\nmet Moore at the Gadsden Mall, and the <em>Post</em> reports that several other\nwomen who used to work there remembered Moore’s frequent\npresence—“usually alone” and “well-dressed in slacks and a button-down\nshirt.”</p>\n<!--{{/photos/5a0a26af40284b1dd15fec9f}}--><p>This past weekend, I spoke or messaged with more than a dozen\npeople—including a major political figure in the state—who told me that\nthey had heard, over the years, that Moore had been banned from the mall\nbecause he repeatedly badgered teen-age girls. Some say that they heard\nthis at the time, others in the years since. These people include five\nmembers of the local legal community, two cops who worked in the town,\nseveral people who hung out at the mall in the early eighties, and a\nnumber of former mall employees. (A request for comment from the Moore\ncampaign was not answered.) Several of them asked that I leave their\nnames out of this piece. The stories that they say they’ve heard for\nyears have been swirling online in the days since the <em>Post</em> published\nits report. “Sources tell me Moore was actually <a href=\"https://www.newamericanjournal.net/2017/11/politics-makes-strange-bedfellows-but-jesus-not-this/\">banned from the Gadsden\nMall and the\nYMCA</a> for his inappropriate behavior of soliciting sex from young girls,” the\nindependent Alabama journalist Glynn Wilson wrote on his Web site on\nSunday. (Wilson declined to divulge his sources.) Teresa Jones, a deputy\ndistrict attorney for Etowah County in the early eighties, told CNN last\nweek that “<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/11/11/moore-high-school-girls-sanchez-marquardt-segment-nr.cnn\">it was common knowledge that Roy dated high-school\ngirls</a>.”\nJones told me that she couldn’t confirm the alleged mall banning, but\nsaid, “It’s a rumor I’ve heard for years.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Greg Legat, who is now fifty-nine and living in East Gadsden, was, from\n1981 to 1985, an employee at the Record Bar, a store that was in the Gadsden Mall. By the early eighties, Legat told me, the mall was\n“the place to be. There were no empty stores. And lots of kids came\naround. Lots of teen-agers. You went there to see and be seen.” Legat\nmet his wife, Jo Anne, there. She worked at a restaurant called Orange\nBowl. Legat remembers that parents dropped their kids off at the mall,\ntypically unchaperoned. Teens filled the place.</p>\n<p>Legat says that he saw Moore there a few times, even though his\nunderstanding then was that he had already been banned. “It started\naround 1979, I think,” Legat said. “I know the ban was still in place\nwhen I got there.” Legat recalled a Gadsden police officer named J. D. Thomas, now retired,\nwho worked security at the mall. “J. D. was a fixture\nthere, when I was working at the store,” Legat said. “He really looked\nafter the kids there. He was a good guy. J. D. told me, ‘If you see Roy, let me know. He’s banned from the mall.’ ” Legat recalled Thomas telling\nhim, “If you see Moore here, tell me. I’ll take care of him.’ ” Legat said that his boss, Eddie Hill, also told him to look for Moore. A phone call to Hill’s number was not returned.</p>\n<p>Reached by phone on Saturday, Thomas, who lives in the nearby town of\nSouthside, declined to discuss the existence of a ban on Moore at the\nGadsden Mall. “I don’t have anything to say about that,” he said. A\nformer manager of the mall, who began working there in the late\neighties, confirmed the existence of a ban list, but did not recall\nMoore being on the list during the manager’s tenure there. Barnes Boyle, who is eighty-six, also managed the mall, from 1981 to 1998. His wife, Brenda, told me that Moore was a longtime acquaintance of his—they went to the Y.M.C.A. together often—and that he planned to vote for him. The recent allegations against Moore, the Boyles thought, are likely liberal propaganda and, as Brenda put it, “a sign of the times.”</p>\n<p>Jason Nelms, an I.T. worker who grew up in nearby Southside and now\nlives in Tennessee, regularly visited the Gadsden Mall as a teen-ager,\nin the early eighties. “It was a joke from one of the managers/assistant\nmanagers that they couldn’t keep an eye on their theater and an eye on\nthe kids outside,” he explained to me via Facebook Messenger. “Us kids\nwould congregate outside on the sidewalk near the theater after the mall\nclosed on Friday and Saturday nights. Anyway, when asked why they had to\nkeep an eye outside, they said that some older guy had been trying to\npick up younger girls. They didn’t go beyond that but one of the\nconcession workers whispered to us later that it was Roy Moore he was\ntalking about.”</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>Gadsden’s current law-enforcement community could not confirm the\nexistence of a mall ban on Moore. But two officers I spoke to this\nweekend, both of whom asked to remain unnamed, told me that they have\nlong heard stories about Moore and the mall. “The general knowledge at\nthe time when I moved here was that this guy is a lawyer cruising the\nmall for high-school dates,” one of the officers said. The legal age of\nconsent in Alabama is sixteen, so it would not be illegal there for a\nman in his early thirties to date a girl who was, say, a senior in high\nschool. But these officers, along with the other people I spoke to, said\nthat Moore’s presence at the mall was regarded as a problem. “I was told\nby a girl who worked at the mall that he’d been run off from there, from\na number of stores. Maybe not legally banned, but run off,” one officer told me. He also said, “I heard from one girl who had to tell the manager of a store at the mall to get Moore to leave her alone.”</p>\n<p>The second officer went further. “A friend of mine told me he was banned\nfrom there,” he said. He added, “I actually voted for Moore. I liked him\nat one time. But I’m basically disgusted now, to be honest with you.\nSome of the things he’s said recently, I’ve changed my tune completely\nabout this guy.” He went on, explaining why Moore no longer appeals to\nhim. “When I heard what he said on ‘Hannity’ the other night,” he said,\nreferring to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiLFiH1ARvo\">an appearance Moore made on Sean Hannity’s radio\nshow</a> last Friday, “I\nalmost stood straight up. The thing about how he’s never dated anybody\nwithout their mother’s permission, that appalled me. That made me want\nto throw up. Why would you need someone’s permission to date somebody?\nI’m probably gonna write in Luther Strange.”</p>\n<p>Moore has mounted various defenses since the <em>Post</em> story appeared.\nAmong these is his “special concern for the protection of young ladies,”\nas he put it to Hannity. The Fox News host pressed for specifics. “I\ndon’t know Ms. Corfman from anybody,” Moore went on. “I never talked to\nher, never had any contact with her.

There\nis no debate. The middle class will, in the long run, pay more in taxes\nthan under current law, and the rich will pay less. For a brief moment\nlast week, there did seem to be space for discussion, in the form of a\ndisagreement between the centrist and highly regarded <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/feature/analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act\">Tax Policy Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/details-analysis-2017-senate-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/\">Tax Foundation</a>,\na pro-business group that is generally seen as more biased. Even if\npoorly matched, having two groups with similar, boring names set the\nstage for the appearance of a two-handed tax debate. One side says it\nhelps the rich, hurts everyone else, and will lead to a bigger deficit;\nthe other side says the opposite. Our media and political system has\nlong viewed economic policy—and, especially, taxation—as the equivalent\nof “American Idol.” There is a group of judges, loudly disagreeing, and\nthe home audience can pick whichever side they like, based on whatever\ncriteria they have. In past tax-news cycles (2001, 1993, 1990, 1986 . . . ),\nthere were enough serious, respected economists on both sides to make it\nseem like there was a real, substantive fight over the impact of taxes\non jobs and economic growth. (While each individual economist appears to\nknow everything with certainty, as a group, they are surprisingly unsure\nof the impact of taxes on a nation’s well-being. However, most <a href=\"http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/taxes\">surveys</a> of economists suggest\nthat virtually none accept the simplistic notion that raising taxes on\nthe rich will cripple an economy.)</p>\n<p>Surely, we will have other debates in the future with thoughtful\narguments on every side. But not this time. The numbers are in and it’s\nclear: this tax bill helps the rich and hurts everybody else. Just ask\nthe very people who wrote it. The U.S. Congress Joint Committee on\nTaxation is run by the chairs of the House Ways and Means Committee and\nthe Senate Finance Committee—Representative Kevin Brady and Senator Orrin Hatch,\nrespectively. The Joint Committee’s <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/\">reports</a> of\nthis week make startling reading, or as startling as a series of\nspreadsheets of tax revenue data can be. The report shows that this bill\nis much like a teaser rate on a new credit card: there are some goodies\nin the first couple of years, but those disappear fairly quickly, at\nleast for those below the median income. In 2019, the first full year\nthat this bill would be law, the benefits are concentrated on the bottom\nof the income stream, with middle-class people, on average, paying just\nunder ten per cent less in taxes than they would if the law weren’t\npassed. With each passing year the benefits shift upward, toward the\nrich. By 2021, those making between twenty thousand and thirty thousand dollars a year\nare paying considerably more in taxes, those between thirty thousand and two\nhundred thousand see their benefit shrinking, and those making more\nstart to see their taxes falling. By 2027, every income level below\nseventy-five thousand dollars a year sees a tax increase, while\neverybody above that level sees a continued decrease, with the greatest\ncut in taxes accruing to those making more than a million dollars a\nyear.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->\n<p>The report shows that the rich benefit and the poor are hurt in every\nway that it measures. For example, the effective tax rate—meaning the\npercentage that people, on average, actually pay after they take all\ndeductions—changes in a precisely regressive form. The poorer you are,\nthe higher your effective rate will rise. By 2027, only those making a\nhundred thousand a year or more will see an actual cut in their\neffective tax rate. And, as could be expected by now, the more they\nmake, the greater the cut in their effective rate. By 2025, there is a\ndirect transfer of money from the poor to the rich and corporations.\nThis is not a flaw but the whole point, Harvard’s Martin\nFeldstein argues. Feldstein is, arguably, the single most widely respected\nRepublican-leaning scholar of tax policy, and one of the few academics\nwho came out in favor of the bill, in a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-tax-reform-is-the-key-to-growth-1509907471\">op-ed</a>.\nHis defense, though, should not give much comfort to the bill’s\nproponents. He argues that cutting individual tax rates won’t increase\neconomic growth and will add to the deficit—which, he acknowledges, is a\nbad thing. But he’s so excited about the corporate tax-rate cut that he\nthinks the bill should pass nonetheless. This is an odd stance, since\nthe corporate rate cuts are about a third the size of the individual\ncuts.</p>\n<p>That is the state of debate on this current bill. Its most respected\ndefender acknowledges that three-quarters of the benefit are a wasted,\nharmful gift for the rich, but a quarter of the benefit goes to\ncorporations, and we must assume they will spend it wisely.</p>\n</section></div></div>"}}]}]}
